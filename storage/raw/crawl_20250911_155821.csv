NATO
allies swiftly held talks Wednesday on the
incursion
by multiple Russian drones into Polish — and alliance — airspace and the shooting down of some of the weapons by Polish and Dutch fighter jets.
The consultations at NATO headquarters were part of a regular meeting of ambassadors from the alliance’s 32 member states known as the North Atlantic Council, but Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk told Parliament that they came under Article 4 of the treaty that founded NATO in 1949 in the aftermath of World War II.
The incident in Poland came three days after Russia’s
largest aerial attack on Ukraine
since the war began.

(Chancellery of the Prime Minister of Poland via AP)
Article 4 can put urgent matters on the agenda
Article 4, the shortest of the NATO treaty’s 14 articles, states that: “The Parties will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened.”
Bob Deen, an analyst at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said the article is “designed to promote better coordination and understanding within the alliance on external threats. It gives all allies the opportunity to urgently put certain threats or developments on the agenda of the North Atlantic Council.”
Article 4 is
increasingly invoked
Poland previously requested such consultations early in Russia’s war on Ukraine. They do not automatically lead to any action under
Article 5
of the treaty, which is NATO’s collective security guarantee, with allies pledging that an attack on one member of the alliance constitutes an attack on all.
“Article 4 gets invoked relatively rarely but increasingly in recent years; Turkey alone invoked it five times between 2003-2020 in the context of Syria and Iraq,” said Deen in emailed comments in response to questions from The Associated Press. “Eight allies invoked it in 2022 shortly after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Poland has triggered it once in 2014 ... after Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea.”
Poland first invoked Article 4 on March 3, 2014, “following increasing tensions in neighboring Ukraine, as a result of Russia’s aggressive actions,” according to the NATO website. And Warsaw joined Bulgaria, Czechia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Slovakia in requesting consultations on Feb. 24, 2022, following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

This doesn’t necessarily mean a step toward Article 5
Deen said that Article 4 is related to Article 5, but is “not necessarily a ‘stepping stone.’”
“Article 5 has only been invoked once, in response to the 9/11 attacks on the United States, immediately bypassing article 4. In other words: Article 4 can be invoked without triggering Article 5, and vice versa,” he said.",https://apnews.com/author/the-associated-press,2025-09-10T12:59:34,,,,,,,2025-09-11T15:55:18

Peter Mandelson
, over his links to the convicted sex offender
Jeffrey Epstein
.
In a statement in the House of Commons on Thursday, Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty said the decision came in the wake of the publication this week of emails Mandelson sent to Epstein in the 2000s, in which he gave his support to the disgraced financier even when he was facing jail for sex offenses.
Doughty said the emails showed that the “depth and extent” of Mandelson’s relationship with Epstein was “materially different” from what was known when he was appointed ambassador to Washington last year after the Labour Party’s election victory.
Mandelson took up his post in February after what the government described as an “extensive” vetting process. He has voiced his deep regret over his previous links with Epstein and said he knew nothing about his criminal activities.
“In light of the additional information in the emails written by Peter Mandelson, the prime minister has asked the foreign secretary to withdraw him as ambassador to the United States,” Doughty said.
In particular, he pointed to Mandelson’s suggestion in an email that Epstein’s first conviction in 2008 was “wrongful and should be challenged.”
Mandelson called Epstein his ‘best pal’
On Wednesday, The Sun newspaper published emails that it said showed Mandelson telling Epstein to “fight for early release” shortly before he was sentenced to 18 months in prison.
“I think the world of you,” Mandelson reportedly told him before he began his sentence in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor.
Mandelson’s links to Epstein came under scrutiny after the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released a
50th birthday album compiled in 2003 for Epstein
that purportedly included a note from U.S. President Donald Trump. In that album, Mandelson called Epstein “my best pal.”
Epstein took his own life in prison in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges, more than a decade after his conviction.
Starmer’s latest headache
The decision to fire Mandelson comes just a day after Starmer said he had “confidence” in him. It’s the latest blow to the prime minister ahead of a state visit by Trump to the U.K. next week, which is likely to be met with protests and some controversy.
Last week Starmer also saw his deputy,
Angela Rayner
, quit over a tax error on a home purchase following days of speculation over her future.
“Mandelson might have gone but, just as with Angela Rayner, Starmer dithered when he needed to be decisive,” said Kemi Badenoch, leader of the main opposition Conservative Party. “He has no backbone and no convictions.”
Following Rayner’s resignation, Starmer carried out a major reshuffle, a forced government reboot after a rocky 14 months in office that have seen his popularity plunge.
Starmer now faces questions over his appointment of Mandelson, who is no stranger to controversy, having twice resigned from former Prime Minister Tony Blair’s government in 1998 and 2001.
After his second resignation from Blair’s government, Mandelson became a European Commissioner when Britain was still in the European Union, before returning to front line British politics in 2008 to serve under Blair’s successor, Gordon Brown.
The Mandelson brief
Mandelson’s trade expertise was considered a major asset in trying to persuade the Trump administration not to slap heavy tariffs on British goods, and seemed to pay off when the countries struck a trade deal in May, though some details of the agreement have yet to be finalized.
He is also a skilled – critics say ruthless – political operator whose mastery of political intrigue brought him the nickname “Prince of Darkness.”
It’s rare for a politician, rather than a career civil servant, to be given a key U.K. ambassadorial post. Mandelson was not an obvious choice as emissary to the Trump administration: he once called Trump a “danger to the world,” words he later said were “ill-judged and wrong.”
The government said James Roscoe, the U.K. deputy head of mission in Washington, will serve as interim ambassador and oversee Trump’s state visit. Roscoe is a career diplomat and former communications chief to the late Queen Elizabeth II.

news,ap_world,,https://apnews.com/article/prince-harry-king-charles-26a71a950773fb222e6f690c124ff0ff,https://apnews.com/article/prince-harry-king-charles-26a71a950773fb222e6f690c124ff0ff,"Prince Harry has tea with his father, King Charles III, in their first meeting in over a year","LONDON (AP) — Britain’s
Prince Harry
joined his father, King Charles III, for tea on Wednesday at the monarch’s London home, the first time they’ve met in well over a year.
The two have been distant since Harry and his wife, Meghan, left royal life and moved to California in 2020 and then publicly aired grievances about the royal family.
Buckingham Palace confirmed that Charles and Harry spent time together at Clarence House, where the king lives when he’s in the capital.
Late Wednesday afternoon, Harry was driven through the gates of the four-story mansion not far from Buckingham Palace. He was seen leaving less than an hour later, as he ducked down in the car enroute to an evening event for his Invictus Games, which supports injured and sick service members and veterans.
There had been speculation that Harry might meet his father after he arrived in the U.K. on Monday, the third anniversary of the
death of his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II
, for a four-day trip during which he will visit several of the charities he supports.
A meeting in July between representatives of the king, 76, and his wayward son, 40, led to suggestions that the
frigid relationship
between Harry and his family might be thawing.
The split had deepened over the past five years as Harry and Meghan aired their grievances with the royal family in a tell-all interview to Oprah Winfrey and a revealing Netflix series. Harry, also known as the Duke of Sussex, then fueled the tensions by revealing personal conversations in
his memoir
, “Spare.”
Harry and his father last met in February 2024, when the prince flew to London after receiving news that Charles had been diagnosed with cancer. Harry spent about 45 minutes with Charles before the king flew to his Sandringham country estate to recuperate from his treatment.
Harry has also had little contact with his elder brother,
Prince William
, heir to the throne.
Harry was
last in London in April
, when the Court of Appeal rejected his bid to restore a police protection detail that was canceled after he stopped being a working royal. Charles was on a state visit to Italy at the time, so a meeting then was impossible.
That case was itself an impediment to improved relations because it involved Harry criticizing the king’s government in the courts. But once it was over, change became possible.
Immediately after the case ended, Harry said he would “love reconciliation with my family.”
“There’s no point in continuing to fight anymore,” he told the BBC on the day the court case was resolved. “Life is precious. I don’t know how much longer my father has.”
Despite that olive branch, Harry had also struck a combative tone. The prince repeatedly said the decision to withdraw his security was made at the direction of the royal household in an effort to control him and his wife while putting their safety at risk.
“What I’m struggling to forgive, and what I will probably always struggle to forgive, is the decision that was made in 2020 that affects my every single day and that is knowingly putting me and my family in harm’s way,” Harry said.
But with the lawsuit out of the way, there were signs of change.
In July, the new team handling Harry and Meghan’s communications, headed by Los Angeles-based Meredith Maines, was seen on the balcony of a private members’ club in London speaking with Tobyn Andreae, the king’s press representative. The Mail on Sunday tabloid took a photo of what it called: “The secret Harry peace summit.”
Regardless of who tipped off the newspaper, it showed a change of tone since the meeting wouldn’t have happened if the principals hadn’t given their tacit consent.
Following the long-awaited meeting Wednesday, Harry dashed to his next charity appearance at an Invictus Games event across town.
When a reporter asked about his father’s health, the prince offered his firsthand opinion: “Yes he’s great, thank you.”",https://apnews.com/author/danica-kirka,2025-09-10T16:52:03,,,,,,,2025-09-11T15:55:22

Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist
and close ally of President Donald Trump who played an influential role in rallying young Republican voters, was shot and killed Wednesday at a Utah college event in what the governor called a political assassination carried out from a rooftop.
“This is a dark day for our state. It’s a tragic day for our nation,” said
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox
. “I want to be very clear this is a political assassination.”

No suspect was in custody late Wednesday, though authorities were searching for a new person of interest, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss the situation by name and spoke on condition of anonymity. Two people were detained earlier in the day but neither was determined to have had any connection to the shooting and both have been released, Utah public safety officials said.
Authorities did not immediately identify a motive but the circumstances of the shooting drew renewed attention to an
escalating threat of political violence in the United States
that in the last several years has cut across the ideological spectrum. The assassination drew bipartisan condemnation, but a national reckoning over ways to prevent political grievances from manifesting as deadly violence seemed elusive.
Videos posted to social media from Utah Valley University show Kirk speaking into a handheld microphone while sitting under a white tent emblazoned with the slogans “The American Comeback” and “Prove Me Wrong.” A single shot rings out and Kirk can be seen reaching up with his right hand as a large volume of blood gushes from the left side of his neck. Stunned spectators are heard gasping and screaming before people start to run away. The Associated Press was able to confirm the videos were taken at Sorensen Center courtyard on the Utah Valley University campus.
People were seen exiting a building on Utah Valley University after Charlie Kirk, the CEO and co-founder of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA, was shot Wednesday at an event on campus.
Kirk was speaking at a debate hosted by his nonprofit political organization. Immediately before the shooting, Kirk was taking questions from an audience member about mass shootings and gun violence.
“Do you know how many transgender Americans have been mass shooters over the last 10 years?” the person asked. Kirk responded, “Too many.”
The questioner followed up: “Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years?”
“Counting or not counting gang violence?” Kirk asked.
Then a single shot rang out. The shooter, who Cox pledged would be held accountable in a state with the death penalty, wore dark clothing and fired from a building roof some distance away to the courtyard where the event took place.
Some 3,000 people were in attendance, according to a statement from the Utah Department of Public Safety, which also said the university police department had six officers working the event along with Kirk’s own security detail.
The death was announced on social media by Trump, who praised the 31-year-old Kirk, the co-founder and CEO of the youth organization
Turning Point USA
, as “Great, and even Legendary.” Later Wednesday, he released a recorded video from the White House in which he called Kirk a “martyr for truth and freedom” and blamed the rhetoric of the “radical left” for the killing.

AP correspondent Haya Panjwani reports on an attack on Charlie Kirk.
Utah Valley University said the campus was immediately evacuated and remained closed. Classes were canceled until further notice. Those still on campus were asked to stay in place until police officers could safely escort them off campus. Armed officers walked around the neighborhood bordering the campus, knocking on doors and asking for information on the shooter.
Officers were seen looking at a photo on their phones and showing it to people to see if they recognized a person of interest.

The event, billed as the first stop on Kirk’s “The American Comeback Tour,” had generated a polarizing campus reaction. An online petition calling for university administrators to bar Kirk from appearing received nearly 1,000 signatures. The university issued a statement last week citing First Amendment rights and affirming its “commitment to free speech, intellectual inquiry, and constructive dialogue.”
Last week, Kirk posted on X images of news clips showing his visit was sparking controversy. He wrote, “What’s going on in Utah?”
The shooting drew
swift condemnation
across the political aisle as Democratic officials joined Trump, who ordered flags lowered to half-staff and issued a presidential proclamation, and Republican allies of Kirk in decrying the violence.
“The attack on Charlie Kirk is disgusting, vile, and reprehensible,” Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who last March hosted Kirk on his podcast, posted on X.
“The murder of Charlie Kirk breaks my heart. My deepest sympathies are with his wife, two young children, and friends,” said Gabrielle Giffords, the former Democratic congresswoman
who was wounded in a 2011 shooting
in her Arizona district.
The shooting appeared poised to become part of a spike of political violence that has touched a range of ideologies and representatives of both major parties. The attacks include the
assassination of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband
at their house in June, the
firebombing of a Colorado parade to demand Hamas release hostages
, and a
fire set at the house of Pennsylvania’s governor
, who is Jewish, in April. The most notorious of these events is the
shooting of Trump during a campaign rally last year
.

Former Utah congressman Jason Chaffetz, a Republican who was at Wednesday’s event, said in an interview on Fox News Channel that he heard one shot and saw Kirk go back.
“It seemed like it was a close shot,” Chaffetz said, who seemed shaken as he spoke.
He said there was a light police presence at the event and Kirk had some security but not enough.

“Utah is one of the safest places on the planet,” he said. “And so we just don’t have these types of things.”
Turning Point was founded in suburban Chicago in 2012 by Kirk, then 18, and William Montgomery, a tea party activist, to proselytize on college campuses for low taxes and limited government. It was not an immediate success.
But Kirk’s zeal for confronting liberals in academia eventually won over an influential set of conservative financiers.
Despite early misgivings,
Turning Point
enthusiastically backed Trump after he clinched the GOP nomination in 2016. Kirk served as a personal aide to Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, during the general election campaign.
Soon, Kirk was a regular presence on cable TV, where he leaned into the culture wars and heaped praise on the then-president. Trump and his son were equally effusive and often spoke at Turning Point conferences.

But did it make any difference?
Traditional news organizations were cautious in their midafternoon coverage of
Charlie Kirk’s assassination
Wednesday not to depict the moment he was shot, instead showing video of him tossing a hat to his audience moments before, and panicked onlookers scattering wildly in the moments after.
In practical terms, though, it mattered little. Gory video of the shooting was available almost instantly online, from several angles, in slow-motion and real-time speed. Millions of people watched.
Video was easy to find on X, on Facebook, on TikTok, on Instagram, on YouTube — even on Truth Social, where President Donald Trump posted official word of the conservative activist’s death. It illustrated how the “gatekeeping” role of news organizations has changed in the era of social media.
Kirk was shot at a public event before hundreds of people at a Utah college campus, many of them holding up phones to record a celebrity in their midst and savvy about how to disseminate video evidence of a news event.
On X, there was a video showing a direct view of Kirk being shot, his body recoiling and blood gushing from a wound. One video was a loop showing the moment of impact in slow-motion, stopping before blood is seen. Another, taken from Kirk’s left, included audio that suggested Kirk was talking about gun violence at the moment he was shot.
For more than 150 years, news organizations like newspapers and television networks have long been accustomed to “gatekeeping” when it comes to explicit content — making editorial decisions around violent events to decide what images and words appear on their platforms for their readers or viewers. But in the fragmented era of social media, smartphones and instant video uploads, editorial decisions by legacy media are less impactful than ever.

Images spread across the country
Across the country in Ithaca, New York, college professor Sarah Kreps’ teenage sons texted her about Kirk’s assassination shortly after school was dismissed and they could access their phones.
No, she told them. He was shot, but there were no reports that he had died. Her son answered: Have you seen the video? There’s no way he could have survived that.
The videos were posted and reposted at lightning speed. One person on X urged “stop the violence” but then included a clip of the shooting. Several people took to social media to plead for people not to spread the images. “For the love of God and Charlie’s family,” read one message, “just stop.”
YouTube said it was removing “some graphic content” related to the event if it doesn’t provide sufficient context, and restricting videos so they could not be seen by users under age 18 or those who are not signed in, the company said.
“Our hearts are with Charlie Kirk’s family following his tragic death,” YouTube said. “We are closely monitoring our platform and prominently elevating news content on the homepage, in search and in recommendations to help people stay informed.”
Meta’s rules don’t prohibit posting videos like Kirk’s shooting, but warning labels are applied and they are not shown to users who say they are under 18. The parent company of Instagram, Facebook and Threads referred a reporter to the company’s policies on violent and graphic content, which they indicated would apply in this case, but had no further comment. An X representative did not immediately return a request for comment.
It’s an issue social media companies have dealt with before, in equally gruesome circumstances. Facebook was forced to contend with people wanting to livestream violence with a
mass shooting in New Zealand
in 2019, said Cornell University’s Kreps, author of the forthcoming book, “Harnessing Disruption: Building the Tech Future Without Breaking Society.”

Getting to the other side
Some images seeped out into more traditional media. TMZ posted a video of Kirk in which a shot and a voice saying, “Oh, my God,” can be heard, but Kirk’s upper body was blurred out. A similar video with a blurred image of Kirk was posted on the New York Post’s website.
In such an atmosphere, the care shown by most traditional news outlets may seem quaint or old-fashioned. But news industry leaders are acutely aware of protecting people from graphic images when they are not expecting it; happening upon them is a little harder online, where many people have to search for and click on an image if they want to see it — if it hasn’t already been sent to you or your group chat.
There can also be an important message sent by news outlets being cautious in what they show, Kreps said. “The traditional media can amplify and validate behavior,” she said. “It can be a signal for how things should be stigmatized, rather than validated or normalized.”
But on the day of the shooting in a politically polarized country, the easy availability of shocking images ran the risk of making society’s wound even more painful.
“I don’t see how many signs of how we get — as a people, as a nation — to the other side of this,” said CNN’s David Chalian. “I think we are broken, and potentially beyond repair.”

a teenage conservative campus activist
to a top podcaster and ally of President Donald Trump,
was shot and killed Wednesday
during one of his trademark public appearances at a college in Utah. He was 31.
Kirk died doing what made him a potent political force — rallying the right on a college campus, this time Utah Valley University. The event was kicking off a planned series of Kirk college appearances from Colorado to Virginia dubbed “The American Comeback Tour.”
His assassination was one of an escalating number of attacks on political figures, from the assassination of a Democratic state lawmaker and her husband in Minnesota to last summer’s shooting of Trump, that have roiled the nation.

Kirk personified the
pugnacious, populist conservatism
that has taken over the Republican Party in the age of Trump. An unabashed Christian conservative who often made provocative statements about gender, race and politics, Kirk launched his organization, Turning Point USA, in 2012, targeting younger people and venturing onto liberal-leaning college campuses where many GOP activists were nervous to tread.
At the center of the right-of-center universe
A backer of Trump during the president’s initial 2016 run, Kirk took Turning Point from one of a constellation of well-funded conservative groups to the center of the right-of-center universe.
Turning Point’s political wing helped run get-out-the-vote efforts for Trump’s 2024 campaign, trying to energize disaffected conservatives who rarely vote. Trump won Arizona, Turning Point’s home state, by five percentage points after narrowly losing it in 2020. The group is known for its events that often feature strobe lighting and pyrotechnics. It claims more than 250,000 student members.
Trump on Wednesday praised Kirk, who started as an unofficial adviser during Trump’s 2016 campaign and more recently became a confidant. “He was a very, very good friend of mine and he was a tremendous person,” Trump told the New York Post.

Kirk showed off an apocalyptic style in his popular podcast, radio show and on the campaign trail. During an appearance with Trump in Georgia last fall, he said Democrats “stand for everything God hates.” Kirk called the Trump vs. Kamala Harris choice “a spiritual battle.”
“This is a Christian state. I’d like to see it stay that way,” Kirk told the 10,000 or so Georgians, who at one point joined Kirk in a deafening chant of “Christ is King! Christ is King!”
Influencing a new generation of conservatives
Kirk was a regular presence on college campuses. Last year, for the social media program “Surrounded,” he faced off against 20 liberal college students to defend his viewpoints, including that abortion is murder and should be illegal.
The author of several books, including one on the Second Amendment, Kirk was a staunch supporter of gun rights.
“I think it’s worth to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God-given rights,” Kirk said during a Turning Point event in Salt Lake City in 2023, adding that gun deaths can be reduced but will never go away.
Admirers stressed that, for all of Kirk’s confrontational rhetoric, he relished debate and the free exchange of ideas. “His entire project was built on reaching across the divide and using speech, not violence, to address and resolve the issues!” William Wolfe, executive director of the Center for Baptist Leadership, posted on X.
Kirk’s style was influential for a new generation of conservatives. Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida spoke on the Capitol steps after the shooting Wednesday, reflecting on Kirk’s influence on her political journey.
“I was supposed to go to medical school. Charlie Kirk called me the day before I was supposed to leave, and recruited me to be the national Hispanic outreach director for the organization,” Luna said. “I was with him at many of them, debating those kids, and that conversation needs to happen. You can’t squelch that.”
Kirk was married to podcaster Erika Frantzve. They have two young children.
Zeal for challenging liberals
Turning Point was founded in suburban Chicago in 2012 by a then 18-year-old Kirk and William Montgomery, a tea party activist, to proselytize on college campuses for low taxes and limited government. It was not an immediate success.
But Kirk’s zeal for confronting liberals in academia eventually won over an influential set of conservative financiers.

Despite early misgivings, Turning Point enthusiastically backed Trump after he clinched the GOP nomination in 2016. Kirk served as a personal aide to Donald Trump Jr. during the general election campaign.
Soon, Kirk was a regular presence on cable TV, where he leaned into the culture wars and heaped praise on the then-president. Trump and his son were equally effusive and often spoke at Turning Point conferences.
Kirk announced he was organizing buses to travel to Washington to back Trump on Jan. 6, 2021, and later invoked the Fifth Amendment rather than answering questions from the Jan. 6 subcommittee.
Also in 2021, as he stepped up criticism of the Black Lives Matter movement on college campuses, Kirk called George Floyd, the Black man whose 2020 murder at the hands of Minneapolis police sparked protests that roiled Trump’s last full year in office, a “scumbag.”
“Just don’t totally mess up this state,” Kirk said at the event in Mankato, Minnesota. “It was built by wonderful Scandinavians, and it seems as if it’s being destroyed now, rather intentionally.”
As money poured in, Kirk bought a $4.75 million Spanish-style estate on a gated Arizona country club. Turning Point steered millions of dollars to contractors owned by Kirk and his associates, and some Republicans were skeptical when it announced it would spearhead an attempt to turn out infrequent voters during Trump’s 2024 campaign.
But as younger voters shifted right in 2024 and Trump ran up a five-point margin of victory in Arizona, Kirk and his allies claimed vindication of his view of a sharp-elbowed, culture-war-oriented conservatism.
Advocate of a new Christian conservatism
Kirk’s
evangelical Christian beliefs were intertwined with his political perspective
, and he argued that there was no true separation of church and state.
He also referenced the Seven Mountain Mandate that specifies seven areas where Christians are to lead — politics, religion, media, business, family, education and the arts, and entertainment.
In the foreword to a book written by a pastor and Turning Point staffer to be published next week, Kirk wrote: “In today’s America, the Christian faithful are faced with a terrifying and broad array of dangers and threats. We are menaced not by new false gods, but by the return of demons from long ago.”
Kirk argued for a new conservatism that advocated for freedom of speech, challenging Big Tech and the media, and centering working-class Americans beyond the nation’s capital.
“We have to ask ourselves a question as a conservative movement: Are we going to revert back to the party of the status quo ruling class?” he said in his speech opening the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2020.
“Or are we going to learn from what I call the MAGA doctrine? The MAGA doctrine, which is a doctrine of American renewal, revival, one that America is the greatest country in the history of the world.”

They were eager to hear what the speaker beneath it had to say. It was a typical university scene, with its promise of the exchange of ideas and debate, except in one way: its size.
This speaker was
Charlie Kirk
, one of the most influential voices in President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” movement, and the event Wednesday at Utah Valley University drew more than 3,000 people. Backpack-toting students watched from surrounding buildings as Kirk, wearing a white T-shirt that said “Freedom,” tossed red MAGA caps, Frisbee-style, to his fans.
He took his place beneath the canopy, the slogans “The American Comeback” and “Prove Me Wrong” emblazoned across it. He picked up a handheld microphone and he began to address the audience.

As he answered a question about gun violence, a single shot cracked.
Campuses were Kirk’s frequent stops
Kirk, 31, a podcaster, founded the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA. He embraced notions of Christian nationalism and often made provocative statements about gender, race, religion and politics. He had insisted that it was worth it to have “some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God-given rights.”
Often he brought those ideas onto college campuses, where they were especially controversial. Kirk was known for openly debating progressives and challenging audiences to stump him on political points.
His campus appearances often drew protests, and Wednesday’s was no different. Online petitions signed by thousands of people had called for his talk at Utah Valley University, as well as another, scheduled for Sept. 30 at Utah State University, to be canceled.
“As students at Utah Valley University, we have come to cherish an environment that strives for inclusivity and diversity,” one said. “Yet, the planned speaking engagement of Charlie Kirk threatens this ideal. Kirk’s presence and the messages he delivers stand in contrast to the values of understanding, acceptance, and progress that many of us hold dear.”
The university responded by affirming its “commitment to free speech, intellectual inquiry, and constructive dialogue.”
No metal detectors or bag checks
As was typical for Kirk’s events, security was light. There were six university police officers assigned to the event, plus some private security. There were no metal detectors or bag checks, students told The Associated Press. Some attendees said no one even checked their tickets.
As Kirk arrived, cheers rose. The crowd packed a terraced courtyard, and students, including some protesters, watched from nearby buildings or overlooks.
“Do you know how many transgender Americans have been mass shooters over the last 10 years?” an audience member asked.
Kirk responded, “Too many.”
The questioner followed up: “Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years?”
“Counting or not counting gang violence?” Kirk asked.
Those were his last words before the bullet struck him. The shot came from a figure in dark clothing on a distant roof on campus, authorities said.
Blood gushed from Kirk’s neck. He held the microphone a moment, then slumped over.

(Tess Crowley/The Deseret News via AP)
Madison Lattin, 21, was a few dozen feet to Kirk’s left when the shot echoed over. Lattin, who’d long looked up to Kirk, watched his body jerk and saw the blood.
And it clicked in her head: “That was a gunshot. Now what?”
Shock, followed by chaos and escape
“No! Charlie!” screamed an audience member.
“Go! Run! Go!” yelled another.
The crowd fled the plaza in multiple directions, some slipping and falling or leaping over benches as they did.
Cari Bartholomew, state director of Utah Moms for America, said she had taken her 17-year-old son out of school so he could attend Kirk’s event. They were joined by other women from the group and their kids. Bartholomew’s son was in line waiting to ask a question when Kirk was shot. Chaos ensued and she couldn’t find him as people ducked for cover and started running. She later learned her son was unharmed.
“All of us, we were trying to grab the little kids and getting them as near to us as possible,” she said.
Ryan DeVries, a 25 year-old who works in property management and volunteers as a first responder, said he was surprised by the lack of a security presence at the event; he left his firearm in his car as he anticipated having to walk through metal detectors.
He was weaving his way through the tightly packed crowd to pose a question to Kirk when he heard what sounded similar to a “popping” firework. Glancing at the stage after the shot was fired, DeVries saw Kirk’s head slumped.
A stampede rife with terror and panic soon erupted, said DeVries. Some attendees darted to a nearby building and ran through a water fountain to escape, he said. Others ducked and hid.
“People definitely feared for their lives. I could see it in their eyes. I could hear it in their voices. People were crying. People were screaming,” DeVries said.

After the panic subsided, Erynn Lammi, a 35-year old student who heard the gunshot, saw AirPods, phones, keys and trash strewn across the courtyard. When she returned home, she said, she cried her eyes out, feeling for Kirk’s wife and children as she was reminded of the loss of her own father when she was 13.
“Powerlessness,” Lammi said.
In hours, his death echoed across the country
The shooting drew condemnation from across the political spectrum as an example of the
escalating threat of political violence in the United States
, including the assassination of a Democratic Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband in June and the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington in May. President Donald Trump was shot in the ear on the campaign trail in western Pennsylvania last year.
“Today, a young man was murdered in cold blood while expressing his political views,” said former President George W. Bush. “It happened on a college campus, where the open exchange of opposing ideas should be sacrosanct. Violence and vitriol must be purged from the public square.”

Democratic former President Joe Biden posted his condolences on X. “There is no place in our country for this kind of violence. It must end now,” he wrote. “Jill and I are praying for Charlie Kirk’s family and loved ones.”
Late Wednesday night, the shooter remained at large. Police helicopters still circled over Orem in the early evening, and roadblocks caused congestion on the streets surrounding the campus. Armed officers walked around in small groups.
Just off campus, a man stood on a street corner holding a sign that read “R.I.P. Charlie.” A parade of trucks drove through town flying American flags in his honor.
At a nearby vigil, a few dozen people gathered, holding electric candles in the slanting afternoon light. As quiet attendees looked on, a chaotic afternoon behind them, speakers read Bible verses.

news,ap_world,,https://apnews.com/article/jeffrey-epstein-files-senate-trump-1793c4c1c2f74f89b0cab9ecfd0cfcc8,https://apnews.com/article/jeffrey-epstein-files-senate-trump-1793c4c1c2f74f89b0cab9ecfd0cfcc8,Senate Republicans defeat Democrats' effort to force the release of Epstein files,"WASHINGTON (AP) — In a close vote, Senate Republicans defeated an effort Wednesday by Democrats to insert language into Congress’ annual defense authorization bill that would have forced the public release of case files on the sex trafficking investigation into the late
Jeffrey Epstein
.
The Senate voted 51-49 to dismiss the changes to the bill, with Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Rand Paul of Kentucky joining with all Democrats in opposition.
For months, Democrats have clamored for the release of what’s become known as the Epstein files, looking for practically every opportunity to force Republicans to either join their push for disclosure or publicly oppose a cause that many in the Republican base support. President
Donald Trump
signaled as he was running for president that he was open to releasing a full accounting of the case, but is now trying to dismiss the push as a “Democrat hoax.”
So far, Democrats have been successful in forcing Republican leadership to grapple with the issue, yet it was unclear whether they would actually be able to crack Trump’s hold on congressional Republicans to force legislation through Congress.
“I ask my Republican colleagues, after all those years you spent calling for accountability, for transparency, for getting to the bottom of these awful crimes, why won’t you vote yes?” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a floor speech Wednesday.
Donald Trump isn’t the only U.S. president to appear in a collection of birthday messages that were sent to Jeffrey Epstein. Former President Bill Clinton and some others who held high positions in business or academia are also included.
The New York Democrat maneuvered earlier Wednesday to force a procedural vote on language that would force the Justice Department to release the Epstein files, inserting it into an annual defense policy bill that Congress has to pass. Senate Republican leadership was then forced to hold a vote to dispense with Schumer’s amendment, arguing that he was inserting political gamesmanship into defense legislation that often enjoys bipartisan support.
“This is not the right way to do it,” said Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican.
Senate Majority Leader John Thune said earlier this week that the Justice Department “has already released tons of files” on Epstein.
“I trust them in terms of having the confidence that they’ll get as much information out there as possible in a way that protects the rights of the victims,” added Thune, R-S.D.
Still, many in the Republican base — as well as some
victims of Epstein’s abuse
— have been unsatisfied with what the Justice Department has so far released.
The calls for disclosure of Epstein’s case has at moments consumed Congress, looming over politics even more than when Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial in 2019 on charges that said he sexually abused and trafficked dozens of underage girls. The case was brought more than a decade after he secretly cut a deal with federal prosecutors in Florida to dispose of nearly identical allegations. Epstein
was accused
of paying underage girls hundreds of dollars in cash for massages and then molesting them.
Asked by reporters Wednesday why Democrats had not pushed for disclosure when they controlled the White House, Schumer responded, “It’s become so apparent that they’re lying about it in every different way and the demands of the American people are so great.”
“The need is greater than ever now,” he added.
Meanwhile, a separate effort to force a vote on a similar bill in the House inched ahead.
Democrats picked up one more House seat when Rep. James Walkinshaw, D-Va., was sworn into office after winning a special election this week. It gives them one more supporter for a procedure — called a discharge petition — to maneuver around Republican leadership’s control of the House floor and hold a vote on legislation to force the Justice Department to release the Epstein files.
Four Republicans have also signed onto the discharge petition, meaning that it is just one name short of having the support needed to potentially force a vote. That could come as soon as the end of this month when a heavily blue congressional district in Arizona holds a special election to fill a vacant seat.",https://apnews.com/author/stephen-groves,2025-09-10T22:31:21,,,,,,,2025-09-11T15:55:33

The 36-year-old Rizzo spent 10 of his 14 major league seasons with Chicago. The infielder hit .272 with 242 home runs and 784 RBIs for the Cubs and helped them win the World Series in 2016.
“Anthony Rizzo was the face of one of the most successful eras in Chicago Cubs history, and we are so excited he will be a part of our organization for many years to come,” Cubs executive chairman Tom Ricketts said in a statement.
Rizzo was a three-time All-Star, four-time Gold Glove winner, one-time Platinum Glove winner and one-time Silver Slugger award winner for the Cubs. He played his rookie season with the San Diego Padres and spent his final seasons with the New York Yankees. He completes his major league career with 1,644 hits, 303 home runs and 965 RBIs in 1,727 games played.
Though Cubs left fielder Ian Happ didn’t make his MLB debut until 2017 with the Cubs, a year after the World Series title, Rizzo and Happ played together in Chicago for more than four seasons.
“The years that he was here, being here for the beginning of that rebuild, through (a) World Series (championship), through playoff success, his numbers speak for themselves when he was here,” Happ said. “What he did for the city, what he did for the people — giving back and charity work — the city embraced him. He embraced the city. It was all pretty incredible.”
The Cubs said Rizzo, who survived Hodgkin lymphoma, has raised millions of dollars through the Anthony Rizzo Family Foundation for cancer research and to help families dealing with the disease. He received
the 2017 Roberto Clemente Award
, the league’s highest community service honor.
Cubs second baseman Nico Hoerner made his MLB debut in 2019 and played with Rizzo until
his departure in 2021.
“I think he did one of the coolest things you can do as an athlete and that was here in Chicago as one of the original building blocks of the future plan for the team,” Hoerner said. “He was (on) some teams that had tough years and then took it as far as you can take it, as far as winning a World Series as part of a dominant group. Obviously the World Series year itself was historic and he was there for every bit of it which is part of why fans really gravitated towards him and why it was so meaningful for him, too.”
Cubs manager Craig Counsell never managed Rizzo but managed against him as an NL Central rival for six-plus years as the Brewers’ skipper.
“It always felt like (Rizzo) was in the middle of everything,” Counsell said. “He was just a really good baseball player. ... He was a great defender. How he handled bunts, he was always a very challenging player to deal with. How he ran the bases for someone who wasn’t that fast, he was just crafty.”
Other Cubs ambassadors are Andre Dawson, Ryan Dempster, Fergie Jenkins, Lee Smith, Billy Williams, Kerry Wood and Ben Zobrist. In memoriam ambassadors include Ernie Banks, Ryne Sandberg and Ron Santo.
“I don’t know what capacity he’ll be around the organization moving forward but it’s so cool to have people around, whether it’s legends like Billy Williams or (Sandberg) or whoever it is that just remind you of the impact that can be had in the organization and the joy that can be created for fans,” Hoerner said. “Having (Rizzo) around like that in any capacity will be really fun.”

The NCAA Committee on Infractions released findings from an
enforcement investigation
that concluded Mykell Robinson, Steven Vasquez and Jalen Weaver bet on one another’s games and/or provided information that enabled others to do so during the 2024-25 regular season; two of them manipulated their performances to ensure certain bets were won. The eligibility was permanently revoked.
The NCAA said a sports integrity monitoring service in January notified Fresno State and NCAA enforcement staff that a Nevada sportsbook operator had flagged suspicious prop bets on Robinson. The investigation began a week later. The Associated Press could not immediately locate the former players for comment.
According to the NCAA, Robinson and Vasquez had been roommates at Fresno State during the 2023-24 season. In January 2025, Robinson and Vasquez, now at San Jose State, discussed over text message that Robinson planned to underperform in several statistical categories during a regular-season game. Robinson also placed multiple bets on Weaver, his teammate at Fresno State in 2024-25, the NCAA found.
The game that drew attention to Robinson was Fresno State’s Jan. 7 matchup with Colorado State. The NCAA said he had three bets based on his his performance – one was $200 to win $1,450; the second was $800 to win $5,800; and the third was $1,200 to win $8,700.
Investigators found that before that game, Robinson told his mother to transfer money by Apple Pay to Vasquez so Vasquez could coordinate a $200 bet on Robinson’s under-line for Robinson. After the game, the NCAA said, Vasquez helped Robinson transfer $1,425 of the winnings to Robinson’s mother. On Jan. 10, Vasquez provided $200 to Robinson.
Also last season, Robinson placed 13 daily fantasy sports over-line and under-line prop bets totaling $454 on parlays that included his own performance. He collected $618 on one occasion, the NCAA said.
Robinson placed bets on Weaver before a game in late December 2024 after he and Weaver exchanged information about their respective betting lines, the NCAA said. Weaver also placed a $50 prop bet on a parlay for himself, Robinson and a third athlete, and he won $260.
Vasquez and Robinson failed to cooperate with the enforcement staff’s investigation, the NCAA said. Weaver cooperated and agreed to the violation in his case.
All three were released from their respective teams and are no longer enrolled at their previous schools. Neither school was punished.
Fresno State said it cooperated willingly with the NCAA.
“The university proactively shared reported information concerning sports wagering activity with the NCAA and worked collaboratively with the NCAA staff throughout the investigation,” the school said in a statement. “While the eligibility consequences for the former student-athletes are significant, the case ultimately resulted in a Level III/Secondary violation and no sanctions for the institution. The university continues to have confidence in the Fresno State Athletics’ culture and is grateful to conclude this matter.”
San Jose State said in a statement that it is aware of the decision and noted that Vasquez had already been removed from the roster several months ago. He graduated in May 2025.
The latest case comes eight years after a
2017 federal investigation
into off-the-books payments to players and their families that, at the time, was against NCAA rules and one of the biggest scandals in the sport’s history.
Since then, the growth of legalized gambling across the United States has raised concerns for college sports leaders and there have been
allegations
against schools
involving betting
, including some against three other basketball programs
earlier this year
.
The NCAA in June said that “several sports betting-related violations by staff members at NCAA schools” have been resolved in recent years and noted its enforcement staff was working on issuing notices of allegations in several ongoing gambling cases.
“The enforcement staff’s sports betting-related caseload has significantly increased in recent years, and our staff — including our new sports betting integrity unit — has been effective in detecting and pursuing violations,” Jon Duncan, NCAA vice president of enforcement, said then.
The nation’s largest college sports organization, overseeing some 500,000 athletes, also said it was considering a proposal that would allow athletes and staff members to bet on professional sports and shift enforcement efforts to college sports betting and “behaviors that directly impact game integrity.” The Division I Council
introduced the proposal
that will be considered this fall and be implemented if Divisions II and III officials also approve.
Current NCAA rules do not allow athletes or institutional staff to engage in sports betting for any sports that have NCAA championships; bets by an athlete on their own team or own sport risks a lifetime ban from college athletics. Those rules would not change under the pending proposal.

The International Tennis Integrity Agency said Wednesday that the sanction will be in effect from Sept. 25 until Oct. 7, so as not to be “unduly punitive” on Hewitt by impacting his Davis Cup schedule.
The incident occurred last November after Hewitt, Australia’s captain, pushed a 60-year-old volunteer anti-doping chaperone after his team’s semifinal loss to Italy.
Hewitt denied the charge — which was brought after a review of video evidence, witness statements, and interviews — pleading self-defense.
The ITIA referred the case to an independent tribunal which upheld the charge of offensive conduct, stating that Hewitt’s actions “did not meet the requirements of self-defense” and that his behavior was “not reasonable and proportionate.”
The 44-year-old Hewitt, a former No. 1-ranked men’s tennis player, has also been fined around $20,000.
Hewitt will be unable to take part in all tennis-related activities during the suspension — including coaching, mentoring, playing, captaincy and other associated roles.
Australia plays Belgium on Sept. 13-14 in Sydney, with a place in the last eight of the Davis Cup Finals on the line.
Hewitt, who won the U.S. Open in 2001 and Wimbledon the following year, has the right to appeal.

Taylor Frankie Paul,
“The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives”
star, will be the lead on Season 22 of “The Bachelorette.” She broke the news herself Wednesday on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast.
ABC confirmed the news in a statement that touted Paul for “igniting ‘MomTok’ and going viral for pulling back the curtain on Salt Lake’s soft-swinging scene.” Paul will return to “The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” for Season 3 in November, and the next season of “The Bachelorette” will premiere in 2026.
“To be honest, surreal,” Paul said when asked about the news by “Call Her Daddy” host Alex Cooper. “It has not hit me right now in this moment. … I’m like, how is this happening? That’s my answer.”
Notably, Paul, 31, has not appeared in the “Bachelor” franchise before, a change from
the usual practice of casting contestants
from previous seasons of “The Bachelor” and “The Bachelorette” as leads. But the pick offers some synergy, as “Bachelorette” broadcaster ABC and “Mormon Wives” streamer Hulu are both owned by Disney. (Two of her current castmates are
headed to “Dancing With the Stars,”
also on ABC.)
Asked by Cooper how the casting choice came about, Paul explained that she’d made a TikTok video on a lark a few years ago, when her relationship “wasn’t working out.”
“I made a funny video,” she said, with the message, “I’m single.”
“It was like a Lindsay Lohan TikTok,” she said, but it somehow caught people’s attention. “I didn’t believe it until I got the invitation,” she said.
Still, Paul said, she was not immediately sure it would be manageable.
The mother-of-three said she wondered: “How do I make this work? I’m a co-parent, I have two baby daddies. … Can I travel that long? Can I be gone that long?”
And then she realized she could do it: “I was just like, I will make it work. If I want to, I can ... I can ask for help.”
Paul became known as an influencer in
the #MomTok community,
a group of women from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sharing their lives on TikTok. She made news when she announced, in 2022, that she had “stepped out” of an agreement with her husband in terms of relationships with other couples involving “soft-swinging” (a form of partner-swapping,) and they were getting divorced.
The following year, Paul was arrested and charged with aggravated assault and other offenses, including domestic violence in the presence of a child, during a dispute with a boyfriend. She pleaded guilty in August 2023 to a misdemeanor charge of aggravated assault; the other charges were dismissed.
Paul told Cooper she didn’t know what it would be like dating several people at a time. She said she had asked some men, “How do people do it? ... I’ve had flings, but this is different.”
Asked what her biggest adjustment would be, she replied: “All of it.”",https://apnews.com/author/the-associated-press,2025-09-10T14:45:19,,,,,,,2025-09-11T15:55:41

But he's standing up for fellow Emmy nominee Colbert,"LOS ANGELES (AP) —
Jimmy Kimmel
is no defender of democracy.
At least he turned down the title when a reporter suggested he might be.
“Those are heavy thoughts and I have a tendency to reject them,” he said backstage this weekend at the
Creative Arts Emmy Awards
. “I don’t really feel like I’m defending democracy.”
He said he’s doing something much smaller when he lays into President Donald Trump.
“I’m giving this guy a little poke, and he deserves it, and I enjoy it, and I hope that people enjoy it too,” Kimmel said.
As the 57-year-old TV personality spoke he was holding his fourth
Primetime Emmy Award
, this one for best game show host for his helming of “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?” He’s up for another Sunday for “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”
Kimmel is, undoubtedly though, a defender of
Stephen Colbert
— and voted for him too.
When his friend and fellow late-night host Colbert had his “Late Show” canceled in July, three days after criticizing a
settlement between Trump and CBS parent company Paramount Global
as it was seeking administration approval for a merger, Kimmel cursed CBS and shared his love for Colbert. Executives insisted the decision was financial.
Later he erected a billboard in Los Angeles declaring “I’m voting for Stephen,” throwing his endorsement to his opponent in their Emmy race in the talk series category.
Kimmel was on a long vacation from ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” when Colbert’s cancellation happened, but weighed in when he returned last week.
“CBS, all of a sudden out of the blue, claimed ‘The Late Show’ was losing $40 million a year and then miraculously got FCC approval to sell their company, which is what they wanted,” he said.
He also responded to Trump, who posted on Truth Social, “I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next,” Trump wrote. “Has even less talent than Colbert.”
“Oh, you delicate, chubby little teacup, did we hurt your feelings?” Kimmel said on his show. “You want us to be canceled because we make jokes about you. I thought you were against cancel culture.”
Somehow none of Kimmel’s Emmys are for the late-night show he’s hosted for 22 years — though most of his 27 nominations are.
One is for hosting the Oscars. Two are for the special all-star recreations of old sitcoms he produced between 2019 and 2021,
“Live in Front of a Studio Audience.”
Asked if he’s given any thought to reviving those, he said not without his partner in the project,
Norman Lear, who died at age 101
in 2023.
“It would be too emotional to do it without Norman,” Kimmel said. “I don’t know if my heart could take it.”
He’s also a three-time Emmys host — a job that this year will go to Nate Bargatze when the show airs on CBS.
And he won a daytime Emmy as best game show host for his work on Comedy Central’s “Win Ben Stein’s Money” way back in 1999, before the award got promoted to primetime.
“When we won that Emmy, we went on the air the same week ‘South Park’ went on the air, and Comedy Central was not a channel that many people watched,” Kimmel said at the Creative Arts Emmys. “And we were up against these titans, the same shows we’re up against now, ‘Wheel of Fortune’ and ‘Jeopardy.’ We didn’t know anyone was watching the show. I think it was the first Emmy Comedy Central ever won.”
Asked how long he plans to keep his current show going, he kept it vague.
“I’m not prepared to answer that question, but it is something I think about a lot,” he said with a smile. “Each day is a new adventure, and I kind of take them as they come, is that a good way of dodging the question?”",https://apnews.com/author/andrew-dalton,2025-09-10T13:22:53,,,,,,,2025-09-11T15:55:43

She was 88.
Holliday died Tuesday at her home in New York, said her theatrical agent, Dennis Aspland. She was the last surviving member of the principal cast of “Alice;”
Linda Lavin,
who played the title character, died last year.
“Alice” ran from 1976 to 1985, but Holliday had turned into such a star that the network gave her her own short-lived spin-off called “Flo” in 1980. It lasted a year.
Holliday earned four Golden Globe nominations and won one in 1980 for “Alice,” as well as four Emmy Award nominations, three for “Alice” and one for “Flo.”
As for the “Kiss my grits!” line, the Alabama-born Holliday was quick to distance herself from it, telling interviewers that the line was “pure Hollywood” and not a regional saying. But she identified with Flo.
“She was a Southern woman you see in a lot of places,” she told The Sarasota Herald-Tribune in 2003. “Not well educated, but very sharp, with a sense of humor and a resolve not to let life get her down.”
Holliday’s career included stints on Broadway — including a Tony nod opposite Kathleen Turner in a 1990 revival of “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof” — and lots of TV, including playing the blind sister to Betty White’s character in “Golden Girls.” On the big screen, her credits included John Grisham 1995 legal thriller series “The Client” and portraying a protective secretary in “All the President’s Men.”
Her Broadway credits include “All Over Town” in 1974 directed by Dustin Hoffman, “Arsenic and Old Lace” in 1986 with Jean Stapleton and Abe Vigoda, and a revival of “Picnic” with Kyle Chandler in 1994.
Some of her more memorable credits include the wicked Mrs. Deagle in “Gremlins,” Tim Allen’s sassy mother-in-law on “Home Improvement” and off-Broadway in “A Quarrel of Sparrows,” in which The New York Times said she radiated “a refreshingly touching air of willed, cheerful imperturbability.”",https://apnews.com/author/mark-kennedy,2025-09-10T22:33:46,,,,,,,2025-09-11T15:55:45

In a stunning few minutes after markets opened, stock in Ellison’s Oracle Corp. rocketed more than a third, enough for him to temporarily wrest the title from its longtime holder Elon Musk and hand it to the software giant’s co-founder.
But the stock market is fickle, and Musk was back on top by the end of the day, at least according to Bloomberg, as Oracle gave up a bit of its earlier gains.
For those keeping score, the difference now is a billion, which isn’t much given the size of the figures: Musk’s $384.2 billion versus $383.2 billion for Ellison.
The dueling fortunes are so big each could fund the lifestyles of 5 million typical American families for a year, about the entire population of Florida, allowing them to all quit their jobs. Or they could just tell all of South Africa to take a vacation for year and produce nothing, based on its gross domestic product.
The brief switch in the ranking came after a blockbuster earnings report from Oracle powered by multibillion dollar orders from customers as the artificial-intelligence race heats up.
Musk became the world’s richest person for the first time four years ago. A big reason is his stake in a hot, but now cooling, electric car maker, Tesla.
Stock in the company has been moving in the opposite direction of Oracle’s, dropping 14% so far this year. Musk also controls several private companies, including rocket maker SpaceX, his artificial intelligence company xAI and the former Twitter, now called X.
Ellison owns about 40% of Oracle, which means its surging stock added $100 billion to his net worth in little over a half-hour after the stock market opened.
The night before, after trading had closed, the company announced in an earnings report that it had struck
more than $300 billion worth of new deals
, including contracts with the OpenAI, Meta, Nvidia and Musk’s xAI. It said that it now expects revenue from its cloud infrastructure business to jump 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year. then rise to $144 billion in four years after that.
Ellison said in an earnings call that Oracle would not just be making money from its computing centers that help build the next chatbots, but from the day-to-day running of those AI systems to run robots in factories, design drugs in laboratories, place bets in financial markets and automate legal and sales work at companies.
In other words, Ellison’s surge in wealth Wednesday morning reflected investor expectations that computers will take over many jobs now done by humans — and Oracle will benefit.
Or as the 81-year-old said on the call, “AI Changes Everything.”
Musk is hoping the same for Tesla and his own net worth, but he’s been struggling to convince investors.
The company had been promising a big turnaround in electric car sales after they fell sharply earlier this year, but the bounce back hasn’t happened. Musk has been downplaying the bad numbers by trying to shift investors’ focus to Tesla’s other business of making robots and advances in the artificial intelligence behind its cars and robotaxis.
While he keeps talking up the Tesla future, though, the bad news keeps coming.
Tesla sales in the European Union
plunged 40%
earlier this summer, the seventh month in row of drops, as customers balked at buying his cars after he took to X to support extreme right-wing politicians there. The company has been losing market share in the U.S., too, as buyers angry with his embrace of Donald Trump have stayed away from Tesla showrooms.
Oracle stock closed Wednesday at $328.33, a 36% jump. Tesla was up less than 1% at $347.79.

Potbelly, which was founded in Chicago in 1977, has 445 restaurants across the U.S. The company said the deal with RaceTrac will help it reach its goal of quadrupling in size to 2,000 locations. Potbelly stores are both company- and franchise-owned.
“With RaceTrac’s resources, we will unlock new opportunity for this incredible brand while staying true to the neighborhood sandwich shop experience that makes Potbelly special,” Potbelly CEO Bob Wright said in a statement Wednesday.
Potbelly shares jumped more than 31% to $16.99 in early afternoon trading.
Sandwich chains have struggled in recent years, starting with the pandemic that had millions eating at home when they would usually have dined out. That made them ripe for takeovers.
In 2021, Restaurant Brands International — which also owns Burger King, Popeye’s and Tim Hortons —
bought Firehouse Subs
for $1 billion. Two years later, the private equity firm Roark Capital
snapped up Subway
for nearly $10 billion.
Roark specializes in franchised businesses and backs two holding companies that own multiple chains, including several sandwich shops. Inspire Brands owns Jimmy John’s, while GoTo Foods owns Schlotzsky’s and McAlister’s Deli.
Potbelly focused on a multi-year transformation plan coming out of the pandemic. The chain introduced new menu items, including a steak sandwich. It also increased its digital and delivery sales, redesigned stores and grew by attracting new franchisees.
In the company’s second quarter, which ended June 29, same-store sales — or sales at locations open at least a year — were up 3%. U.S. fast food traffic fell 1% industry-wide during the quarter, according to Revenue Management Solutions Co., a consulting company for restaurants.
Still, the future is cloudy for many restaurant chains.
Inflation has hit restaurants hard
as they pay more for ingredients and customers tighten their belts.
National chains are also being pressured to lower prices with lower-income customers pulling back on spending. McDonald’s said this month that it is
cutting prices
on some combo meals to
woo back customers
who’ve been turned off by the rising cost of grabbing a fast food meal.
Some investors had been pushing Potbelly to consider a sale, saying the company’s stock was undervalued compared to competitors. Immersion Investments, one of Potbelly’s top shareholders, urged a sale in an open letter last fall and called on the company to slow its investments in technology and hiring.
RaceTrac was founded in 1934 and is family owned. The Atlanta company operates more than 800 locations in 14 states. RaceTrac Chairman and CEO Natalie Morhous said the company is eager to expand its stable of brands.
RaceTrac said it will acquire all of Potbelly’s shares for $17.12 each in cash.
The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter.",https://apnews.com/author/dee-ann-durbin,2025-09-10T14:07:48,,,,,,,2025-09-11T15:55:49
news,ap_world,,https://apnews.com/article/inflation-economy-trump-federal-reserve-fabecefa501709184895bf73b3dc698a,https://apnews.com/article/inflation-economy-trump-federal-reserve-fabecefa501709184895bf73b3dc698a,"US inflation worsened last month, putting Fed in difficult spot as job market slows","WASHINGTON (AP) — Inflation rose last month as the price of gas, groceries, and airfares jumped, while a measure of layoffs also increased, putting the Federal Reserve in a tough spot as it prepares to cut rates at its meeting next week despite persistent price pressures.
Consumer prices increased 2.9% in August from a year earlier, the Labor Department said Tuesday, up from 2.7% the previous month and the biggest increase since January. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 3.1%, the same as in July. Both figures are above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.
The reading is the last the Fed will receive before their two-day meeting the begins Tuesday, where policymakers are widely expected to cut their short-term rate to about 4.1% from 4.3%. Still, the new inflation data underscores the challenges the Fed is facing as it experiences
relentless pressure
from President Donald Trump to cut rates. Inflation remains stubborn while the job market is
weakening
, diverging trends that require polar reactions from Federal Reserve policymakers to address.
Hiring
has slowed sharply in recent months
and was
lower than previously estimated
last year. The unemployment rate ticked up in August to a still-low 4.3%. And weekly unemployment claims
rose sharply last week
, the government also reported Thursday, a sign layoffs may be picking up.
The number of people seeking unemployment benefits
jumped 27,000 to 263,000
, the most in nearly four years. Applications for jobless aid are considered a proxy for layoffs.
Economists said the rise in jobless claims shook financial markets and make it more likely the Fed will steadily reduce borrowing costs this year.
“Consumer inflation came in mildly hotter than forecast, but not nearly high enough to prevent the Fed from starting to cut rates next week,” Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist for Nationwide, said. “The labor market is losing steam and reinforces that the Fed needs to start cutting rates next week and that it will be the start of a series of rate reductions.”
Typically the Fed would cut its key rate when unemployment rose to spur more spending and growth. Yet it would do the opposite and raise rates — or at least keep them unchanged — in the face of rising inflation. Last month, Chair Jerome Powell signaled that Fed officials are increasingly concerned about jobs. Yet stubbornly high inflation could keep the Fed from cutting very quickly.

On a monthly basis, overall inflation accelerated, as prices rose 0.4% from July to August, faster than the 0.2% pace the previous month. Core prices rose 0.3% for the second straight month.
Gas prices jumped 1.9% just from July to August, the biggest monthly increase since a 4% rise in December. Grocery prices climbed 0.6%, pushed higher by more expensive tomatoes, apples, and beef. The cost of travel soared, with air fares rising 5.9% just from July to August and hotel room prices rising 2.3%. Rental costs also increased, rising 0.4%, faster than the previous month.
Trump’s sweeping tariffs pushed up the prices of many imported goods. Clothing costs rose 0.5% just last month, though they are still just slightly more expensive than a year ago. Furniture costs rose 0.3% and are 4.7% higher than a year earlier. Appliance costs also rose from July to August, after falling the previous month.
The inflation data arrives at the same time that Trump has sought to
fire Fed governor Lisa Cook
as part of an effort to assert more control over the Fed. Yet late Tuesday, a court said the
firing was illegal
and ruled that Cook could keep her job while the dispute played out in the courts.
Some restaurant owners have boosted prices to offset the rising costs of food. Cheetie Kumar, who owns Mediterranean eatery Ajja in Raleigh, North Carolina, said she’s facing higher costs on everything ranging from spices she imports from India, coffee and chocolate she gets from Brazil, and soy she gets from Canada.
“Those are things that I cannot source locally, we do source a lot of produce and meat and everything else from local farmers, but I don’t know any nutmeg growers in North Carolina,” she said.
Her overall costs are up about 10% from a year ago, with beef costs up 7%, and much bigger increases for things like coffee, chocolate (300%) and spices (100%).
She’s raised prices on some of her menu items by $1 or $2, but said she’s at the limit of how much she can do so before demand wanes and she stops earning a profit.
Bigger companies are also feeling the pinch.
E.L.F. Cosmetics said this spring that it was raising prices by $1. Last month, however, CFO Mandy Fields said it is no longer certain whether the $1 price increases will be enough to offset rising tariff costs.
Plenty of other retailers and brands haven’t spelled out specific price hikes but many, including Home Depot and Macy’s, have described them as modest or say they are taking a surgical approach.
Shoppers have yet to feel the big sting economists predicted had earlier in the year after many retailers ordered goods ahead of tariffs and who also have absorbed a big chunk of the costs rather then passing them along to consumers grown increasingly leery of price increases.
But Walmart and other big chains have warned of costs increases as they replenish their inventories, with the full impact of tariffs in effect.

(AP) — NASA’s
Mars rover Perseverance
has uncovered rocks in a
dry river channel
that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life, scientists reported Wednesday.
They stressed that in-depth analysis is needed of the sample gathered there
by Perseverance
— ideally in labs on Earth — before reaching any conclusions.
While acknowledging the latest analysis “certainly is not the final answer,” NASA’s science mission chief Nicky Fox said it’s ”the closest we’ve actually come to discovering ancient life on Mars.”
Roaming Mars since 2021
, the rover cannot directly detect life, past or present. Instead, it carries a drill to penetrate rocks and tubes to hold the samples gathered from places judged most suitable for hosting life billions of years ago. The samples are awaiting retrieval to Earth — an ambitious plan that’s on hold as
NASA seeks cheaper, quicker options
.
Calling it an “exciting discovery,” a pair of scientists who were not involved in the study — SETI Institute’s Janice Bishop and the University of Massachusetts Amherst’s Mario Parente — were quick to point out that non-biological processes could be responsible.
“That’s part of the reason why we can’t go so far as to say, ‘A-ha, this is proof positive of life,’’’ lead researcher Joel Hurowitz of Stony Brook University told The Associated Press. “All we can say is one of the possible explanations is microbial life, but there could be other ways to make this set of features that we see.”
Either way, Hurowitz said it’s the best, most compelling candidate yet in the rover’s search for potential signs of long-ago life. It was the 25th sample gathered; the tally is now up to 30. The findings appeared in the journal Nature.
“It would be amazing to be able to demonstrate conclusively that these features were formed by something that was alive on another planet billions of years ago, right?” Hurowitz said. But even if that’s not the case, it’s “a valuable lesson in all of the ways that nature can conspire to fool us.”
Collected last summer, the sample is from reddish, clay-rich mudstones in Neretva Vallis, a river channel that once carried water into Jezero Crater. This outcrop of sedimentary rock, known as the Bright Angel formation, was surveyed by Perseverance’s science instruments before the drill came out.
This image provided by NASA shows the 360-degree view of a region on Mars called “Bright Angel,” captured on June 12, 2024 by NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover and is made up of 346 individual images that were stitched together after being sent back to Earth. (NASA via AP)
Along with organic carbon, a building block of life, Hurowitz and his team found minuscule specks, dubbed poppy seeds and leopard spots, that were enriched with iron phosphate and iron sulfide. On Earth, these chemical compounds are the byproducts when microorganisms chomp down on organic matter.
“There is no evidence of microbes on Mars today, but if any had been present on ancient Mars, they too might have reduced sulfate minerals to form sulfides in such a lake at Jezero Crater,” Bishop and Parente wrote in an accompanying editorial.
There’s no evidence of present-day life on Mars, but NASA over the decades has sent spacecraft to Mars in search of past watery environments that might have supported life way back when.
When Perseverance launched in 2020, NASA expected the samples back on Earth by the early 2030s. But that date slipped into the 2040s as costs swelled to $11 billion, stalling the retrieval effort.
Until the samples are transported off of Mars by robotic spacecraft or astronauts, scientists will have to rely on Earthly stand-ins and lab experiments to evaluate the feasibility of ancient Martian life, according to Hurowitz.
NASA’s acting Administrator Sean Duffy said budgets and timing will dictate how best to proceed, and even raised the possibility of sending sophisticated equipment to Mars to analyze the samples on the red planet. “All options are on the table,” he said.
Ten of the titanium sample tubes gathered by Perseverance were placed on the Martian surface a few years ago as a backup to the rest aboard the rover, all part of NASA’s still fuzzy return mission.

AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. The county medical examiner’s office ruled Floyd’s death a homicide due to “cardiopulmonary arrest,” not an overdose, even though he had fentanyl and methamphetamine in his system. Medical experts at the murder trial for one of the former police officers involved also testified Floyd died of a lack of oxygen from being pinned to the pavement with a knee on his neck, not from drug use. A jury unanimously agreed, finding the former officer guilty of murder and manslaughter.
THE FACTS: Social media users in recent days have revived false claims surrounding the death of Floyd during an arrest by Minneapolis police more than two years ago.
The claims resurfaced after rapper Kanye West, legally known as Ye, cast doubt on the circumstances of Floyd’s May 25, 2020, death
during a recent podcast appearance
, and as the criminal trial for two other police officers involved is
set to open next week
.
“They hit him with the fentanyl. If you look, the guy’s knee wasn’t even on his neck like that,” West said, citing a new documentary from conservative commentator Candace Owens. The documentary focuses on the Black Lives Matter movement that Floyd’s death helped spark, but also delves into the fentanyl claims.
“I never heard none of this fentanyl talk till recently,” another user wrote in a lengthy Instagram post that also references West’s comments and Owens’ documentary. “Did you all know this or is this new information to you as well?”
But the presence of fentanyl and other illicit substances isn’t a new revelation.
In fact, it was a major focus for defense attorneys in the murder trial of Derek Chauvin, the officer captured on video placing his knee on Floyd’s neck. He was ultimately
sentenced to more than 22 years in prison
.
The Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s office ruled Floyd’s death a homicide due to “cardiopulmonary arrest” from “law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.”
Floyd, who had a history of heart disease and opioid addiction, was also found with 11 nanograms per milliliter of fentanyl in his system as well as 19 nanograms per milliliter of methamphetamine,
according to the office’s autopsy
.
Lewis Nelson, director of the medical toxicology division at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, told the AP on Thursday that the medical examiner’s office and the
expert witnesses called by prosecutors
during the trial properly
concluded that Floyd did not die of an overdose
or because of his drug use.
He said the amount of fentanyl found in Floyd’s system could be lethal for a first-time user or a young child or a smaller adult, but likely not for Floyd, who was 46 years old, stood more than six feet tall, weighed more than 200 pounds and
struggled with opioid addiction
.
Nelson also dismissed the amount of meth in Floyd’s system as “trivial.”
“If somebody was a chronic user and their blood level was 11, we wouldn’t be particularly concerned,” Nelson said of the amount of fentanyl in Floyd. “In fact, sometimes people could be in withdrawal with levels of 11. It’s tricky. You have to put it in context.”
Leo Beletsky, an opioid expert at Northeastern University in Boston who was also not involved in the trial, agreed, noting that Floyd didn’t exhibit the typical signs of opioid overdose.
“They fall into a sleep-like state,” he said of overdose victims. “They have shallow breathing. They stop talking. Their face turns ashen or their fingertips turn blue and their lips turn pale. The physical responses that he was having were much more consistent with trauma than an overdose.”
Some social media users have also claimed that video of Floyd’s death shows Chauvin’s knee wasn’t pressed on his neck the entire time, giving him moments to catch his breath and not suffocate, a point that’s also raised in Owens’ documentary.
That too was a focal point for defense lawyers during the trial and isn’t a new argument. An
expert witness for the prosecution testified
Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck area nearly the full 9 1/2 minutes he was pinned to the ground.
Jody Stiger, a Los Angeles police officer and use-of-force expert, said during trial that Chauvin appeared to bear down on Floyd with his full weight, even if there were moments he might have briefly shifted the knee to Floyd’s shoulder blade area or the base of his neck.
“Defense attorneys for Chauvin were throwing everything at the wall to see what would stick,” Lee Merritt, a lawyer representing Floyd’s brother, Philonise, told the AP by phone. “But their arguments were proven false in the criminal and civil cases.”
Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison’s office, which prosecuted Chauvin, and Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s office both declined to comment, citing the upcoming trial of former officers J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao.
Representatives for West and Owens also didn’t respond to emails seeking comment this week, but lawyers for Floyd’s family say they
intend to sue West
for harassment, defamation and emotional distress.
Kay Harper Williams, who represents Floyd’s young daughter and her mother, said in a statement to the AP the family is being “retraumatized” by the false claims that “essentially undermine our justice system and the legacy of George Floyd.”

A new autopsy report for George Floyd has been released in 2023, revealing he died from a drug overdose,
not from the actions of arresting Minneapolis police officers.
AP’S ASSESSMENT: False.
Social media users are sharing a page
from the 20-page
autopsy report
that
was publicly released
by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s office
in full on June 3, 2020.
It has not been changed since. While the page says he had fentanyl and methamphetamine in his system, and did not have “life-threatening injuries,” the full report
concludes
Floyd died from “cardiopulmonary arrest,”
not an overdose.
THE FACTS: As the
three-year anniversary
of Floyd’s death arrived on Thursday, some social media users shared what they erroneously claimed was new evidence about the circumstances of his passing.
Many of the posts presented a page from
an
autopsy report that supposedly had not been made public before. One section on the page
lists the drugs that were in Floyd’s system when he died, while another states
, “no life-threatening injuries identified.”
“BREAKING NEWS: George Floyd full autopsy released,” reads one tweet. “Says ‘no life threatening injuries identified’ and reveals high levels of multiple additional toxic drugs on top of the Fentanyl that was initially reported.” It had received more than 48,000 likes and more than 16,000 shares by Friday.
Another tweet that had received more than 29,600 likes and more than 6,600 shares stated that “the coroner’s report says Floyd died from drugs - not COPS.”
But the image being shared online
simply
shows the second page of the
autopsy report
released three years ago by Hennepin County.
It does not prove anything new about Floyd’s death, and ignores that the prior page concludes that it was a homicide due to “cardiopulmonary arrest” from “law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.”
Carolyn Marinan, a spokesperson for Hennepin County, confirmed that the report “has not been amended or changed since it was finalized on June 1, 2020.”
John Stiles, deputy chief of staff for Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison,
said that
the image “is a page ripped from the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s 2020 autopsy” and shows “nothing new.”
During his murder trial, defense attorneys for Derek Chauvin, the officer captured on video placing his knee on Floyd’s neck during the fatal arrest,
put a major focus on the presence of fentanyl and other illicit substances in Floyd’s system. Chauvin was ultimately found guilty and
sentenced to more than 22 years in prison
. Three other former Minnesota cops — Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao — have also been
given prison time
for their role in Floyd’s death.
Expert witnesses
called by prosecutors during the trial concluded that Floyd did not die of an overdose or because of his drug use.
Independent experts have
previously told
the AP that underlying medical problems and drug use revealed in the autopsy report don’t change the conclusion that Floyd’s death was a homicide, explaining that these conditions simply made it more likely that he would not fare well under stress.
They have also noted that the fact that no major bruising or damage to the muscles, cartilage or bones in the neck was found — as indicated under the phrase “no life-threatening injuries identified” in the autopsy —
does not mean
that asphyxia did not occur. Only that there are no signs of it on the body.
Stiles called use of the phrase in the false posts spreading online “cherry-picked” and said that it “demonstrates the limitations of an autopsy by itself in diagnosing death by asphyxiation.”

Online posts falsely claim sharpshooter was told not to fire on suspect in Trump shooting
CLAIM: A law enforcement sniper assigned to Trump’s rally Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania, says the head of the Secret Service ordered him not to shoot the suspect accused of attempting to assassinate Trump.
THE FACTS: No such order was made.
Snipers killed the suspected shooter
moments after he opened fire on the former president, bloodying Trump’s ear,
killing one rally attendee
and injuring two. The Secret Service and the Butler Police Department say they have no agents, officers or employees with the name of the person claiming to be the sharpshooter.
Following Saturday’s attempt on Trump’s life, a poster on the online message board 4chan wrote that they were a sniper assigned to the rally, and that they can be seen in a photo of two law enforcement officers on the roof at the rally.
“My name is Jonathan Willis,” the poster wrote. “I came here to inform the public that I had the assassin in my sights for at least 3 minutes, but the head of the secret service refused to give the order to take out the perp. 100% the top brass prevented me from killing the assassin before he took the shots at president Trump,” the post claimed.
But there is no agent or officer by the name of Jonathan Willis working for the Secret Service or the Butler police, and no internet records of such an officer could be located.
A spokesman for the Secret Service said snipers are trained and instructed to act whenever they see a threat, and do not await instructions before taking a shot to neutralize a suspect. He said he couldn’t discuss the specifics of agency communication or the details of the ongoing investigation, but said the post was false.
Witnesses at the rally alerted law enforcement to the suspect, identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks, after they saw him perched atop a nearby roof. A local law enforcement officer climbed to the roof and found Crooks, who pointed the rifle at the officer. The officer retreated, and the gunman quickly fired toward Trump, the officials said. That’s when U.S. Secret Service gunmen shot him, officials have said.
Crooks, a nursing-home employee from suburban Pittsburgh,
fired multiple shots
at Trump with an AR-style rifle. A spectator was killed and two others were critically injured.
Authorities said the shooting was an attempted assassination, but haven’t yet determined what motivated Crooks to try to kill Trump,

Posts misrepresent photo to claim Trump was shot in the chest and saved by a bulletproof vest
CLAIM: A photo shows a bullet hole in Trump’s suit jacket, proving that he was shot in the chest during the
attempted assassination
.
THE FACTS:
The photo
actually shows a fold in the suit jacket of a Secret Service agent protecting Trump.
Another Associated Press image
taken moments before clearly shows there is no hole in Trump’s jacket. What appears to be a hole can be seen diminishing as the agent moves
in video
of the shooting’s aftermath.
Social media users are sharing the photo from the
assassination attempt
to claim that the former president was shot in the chest. Some posts suggest he survived because he was wearing a bulletproof vest.
In the image, what seems to be a small hole appears inches below Trump’s right underarm. Many posts use a zoomed-in version of the photo that has a circle around the supposed hole to emphasize the hard-to-notice detail.
“#Trump was also shot in the chest,” reads one X post. “The bulletproof vest saved him #We support Trump.
Another X post similarly reads, “It appears that Trump was shot in the chest, as the bullet seem to have pierced his suit; he was wearing a bulletproof vest.”
But the apparent hole is actually a fold in the sleeve of the Secret Service agent’s jacket, not the aftermath of a bullet.
The photo
taken by an
AP photographer
shows the agent bending over as she protects Trump, her jacket appearing slightly darker than the former president’s. The fold can be seen by following the edge of the agent’s jacket from her neck to just below her left shoulder.
Moreover,
another AP image
taken moments before the one with the supposed hole clearly shows the right side of Trump’s jacket as he raises his fist. No hole can be seen in the jacket.
Trump
wrote on his social media platform
that he was “shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.” Photos and video from the rally show blood on his right ear and on the right side of his face.
The Secret Service declined to comment on details of the shooting, including where the bullets hit, and did not respond to a follow-up inquiry about whether Trump was wearing a bulletproof vest. Trump’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

Photo edited to make it appear Secret Service agents were smiling after attempt on Trump’s life
CLAIM: A photo from the
attempted assassination
of Trump shows Secret Service agents smiling as they surround him after the shooting.
THE FACTS: The photo was edited to make it appear the agents were smiling. In
the original
, taken by an
Associated Press photographer
, the same agents can be seen with neutral expressions.
After
the shooting,
social media users shared the altered image, with some suggesting it was evidence that the assassination attempt had been staged.
The photo shows Trump with blood on his face and ear, pumping his fist in front of an American flag while Secret Service agents surround him. Three agents whose faces are visible seem to be grinning as they protect the former president.
“Why are all 3 Secret Service agents smiling, at least that is how it appears to me,” reads one post on X. “Do to the seriousness of the situation, I would think their expressions would be grim + determined. Now, if it was a staged event, these expressions would make more sense.”
But the agents were not smiling at that moment. The photo was edited to make it appear otherwise.
The original image shows the same three agents with neutral expressions. One man is positioned behind Trump, a second man stands by his left shoulder and a woman is bent over on his right side, beneath his raised arm.

AP’S ASSESSMENT: Satire. Human remains have not been found in McDonald’s factories. This false claim is a years-old hoax that first appeared on the satirical blog Huzlers.com in 2014.
THE FACTS: On Aug. 23, a Facebook page with a history of spreading conspiracy theories shared another bogus rumor: that human meat was discovered at a McDonald’s meat factory.
“First Horse meat, then the mysterious ‘Pink slime’, Now Human meat?” read the post viewed by more than 51,000 Facebook users.
The baseless post also claimed that the human remains came from children, and that health inspectors following up on the case “horrifyingly found human meat in about 90% of the factories inspected thus far.”
The Facebook page The Hidden Truth shared the information as true, but included a link that redirected Facebook users to Huzlers.com, a satire blog.
The story on Huzlers.com had no official sources or evidence, and was first shared in March 2014, according to a search of internet archives.
McDonald’s patties are made of 100% beef, according to the company’s website.

AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. That long-circulating claim misrepresents remarks about $2.3 trillion in accounting entries that officials at the time said were insufficiently documented because of outdated technology. The entries were made during fiscal year 1999 and detailed in an early 2000 report.
THE FACTS: More than two decades after the 9/11 attacks,
false claims
and
conspiracy theories
about the events continue to surface online.
One meme being shared ahead of the 22-year anniversary is repeating a debunked assertion that the attacks were somehow related to “trillions” of taxpayer dollars going missing.
“The US Government when they found a way to distract people from the trillions of dollars they mysteriously lost on Sept. 10, 2001,” the Instagram post reads. The post uses visuals, including a photo of the Twin Towers, to suggest the attacks were the purported distraction.
But it’s not true that the government “mysteriously lost” trillions the day before 9/11.
Instead, the long-circulating claim refers to
remarks
that then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld gave on Sept. 10, 2001, about the Pentagon’s business practices.
“The technology revolution has transformed organizations across the private sector,” Rumsfeld said at one point. “But not ours, not fully, not yet. We are, as they say, tangled in our anchor chain. Our financial systems are decades old. According to some estimates, we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions.”
But Rumsfeld wasn’t saying the Department of Defense was missing $2.3 trillion. He was using the number to illustrate that the department was having trouble keeping track of its finances because of outdated technology.
Moreover, while Rumsfeld did reference the figure the day before 9/11, it wasn’t new information.
The figure was included in a
February 2000 audit report
for fiscal year 1999 by the Defense Department’s inspector general, which noted: “For the accounting entries, $2.3 trillion was not supported by adequate audit trails or sufficient evidence to determine their validity.”
Later that year, Robert Lieberman, who was then the assistant inspector general for the department, cited the $2.3 trillion number during
testimony
before a congressional task force in which he discussed “how difficult it has been for DOD to emulate private sector financial reporting practices.”

The history of the Finnish air force’s use of the swastika, which since the 20th century has largely been associated with Nazi tyranny and hate groups, is more complex than at first appearance. It is an ancient symbol and Finland’s air force began using it many years before the birth of Nazi Germany.
Change has been underway for years. A swastika logo was quietly pulled off the
Air Force Command’s unit emblem
a few years ago. But swastikas have remained on some Finnish air force flags, raising eyebrows among NATO allies, tourists and other foreigners who spot them at military events.
“We could have continued with this flag, but sometimes awkward situations can arise with foreign visitors. It may be wise to live with the times, Col. Tomi Böhm, the new head of Karelia Air Wing air defense force, was quoted as saying in a report Thursday by the public broadcaster YLE.
A bad look for a new NATO member
The Defense Forces, in an email to The Associated Press on Friday, said a plan to renew the air force unit flags was launched in 2023, the year Finland joined NATO, but said it was not linked to joining the alliance. The aim, it said, was “to update the symbolism and emblems of the flags to better reflect the current identity of the Air Force.”
It referred to an article in daily Helsingin Sanomat on Friday, which said the reason for the removal was a perception that the swastika has been an “embarrassing symbol in international contexts.”
Finland, which shares a long border with Russia,
joined NATO in April 2023
over concerns related to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Teivo Teivainen, a professor of world politics at the University of Helsinki, said the flags in question were introduced in the 1950s and today are flown by four Air Force units.
The Air Force and the Finnish public generally had for years insisted the swastikas used in Finland’s air force “have nothing to do with the Nazi swastika,” said Teivainen, who this month had a book published whose Finnish title translates as “History of the Swastika.”
But now, following Finland’s integration with NATO, policymakers have decided “there’s now a need to get more integrated with the forces of countries like Germany, the Netherlands, and France — countries where the swastika is clearly a negative symbol,” he said.
Teivainen said that in 2021, German air force units bowed out of a final ceremony following exercises at a military base in Finland’s Lapland region after learning that the Finnish swastikas would be on display.
A symbol used for more than a century
Finland’s air force adopted the swastika emblem in 1918 soon after country gained its independence after more than a century of Imperial Russian rule.
Count Eric von Rosen of neighboring Sweden donated Finland’s first military plane in 1918, which bore his personal symbol, the swastika.
The Finnish air force soon after adopted a blue swastika on a white background as the national insignia on all its planes from 1918 to 1945. After the war, the imagery remained for decades on some Air Force unit flags and decorations as well as on the insignia of the Air Force Academy.
But that doesn’t mean there is no Nazi connection at all.
Von Rosen, an aristocratic explorer and ethnographer, was the brother-in-law of Hermann Goering, a decorated World War I German fighter pilot who became an early Nazi Party member. Goering went on to lead Germany’s Luftwaffe during World War II under Hitler.
The Finnish air force stressed that its use of the symbol had no connection to Nazi Germany, although Finland entered into a reluctant alliance with the Third Reich during World War II.
New flags — featuring an eagle — will be published when the work has been completed and the flags are introduced into use for events like parades and local ceremonies, the Defense Forces said, without saying when that would happen.
“The traditional Von Rosen swastika emblem, in use since 1918, has already been removed from most other Air Force emblems during earlier reforms, so its removal from the unit flags is a logical continuation of this work,” the emailed statement said.

The little creature also is a ferocious tunneler, and it’s exasperating the people of Minot, North Dakota, where it’s burrowing everywhere from vacant lots to the middle of town, and growing more plentiful over the past two decades.
Now North Dakota’s fourth-largest city is fighting back, but even the pest control guy leading the charge acknowledges that it will be difficult to turn the tide against the rodent.
An uphill battle
Joshua Herman said fighting the squirrels is akin to “one guy standing against a massive storm.”
“If I’m trapping but my neighbor isn’t, well then, we’re really not going to get anywhere with it, long-term,” Herman said.

Ground squirrels have been an issue in Minot, a city of nearly 50,000 people, for at least 20 years, but the problem has dramatically worsened in the last few years, said Minot Street Department Superintendent Kevin Braaten.
It’s unclear how many of the squirrels live in Minot but it likely nears or even exceeds the city’s population.
“Gosh, there’s got to be tens of thousands of them in the area,” Herman said.
Officials in the city, a green spot along the winding Souris River surrounded by farmland and grassy prairie, know they can’t get rid of the squirrels, but hope to simply get the rodent numbers down.
“I don’t see the population ever going to zero,” Braaten said. “I mean, it’s almost impossible by the numbers that we have.”
Put another way, Minot won’t be able to rid itself of the squirrels because the animals have lived on the prairie for centuries. Outside of town, predators like coyotes, badgers, owls and even snakes love to dine on the squirrels. But in residential neighborhoods and even downtown, where few of their predators live, the rodents can roam pretty freely.
Greg Gullickson, an outreach biologist with the North Dakota Game and Fish Department, adds that the squirrels now have fewer grassland areas available to them and like the mowed spots they find in town.
No land is safe
Female squirrels typically give birth to litters of about six babies a year, so it’s easy to see how their numbers can quickly soar.
Herman said he kills 3,500 to 5,000 of them a year, primarily by putting snares and carbon monoxide into the holes, and using an air rifle.

“I’ve had calls downtown, calls in the mall, along the highways, here at the airport — really every part of the city I’ve done trapping for ground squirrels here in Minot,” Herman said as he checked his traps along an apartment building and shoveled dirt over holes.
Herman says they damage driveways, sidewalks and lawns; create tripping hazards with their holes and can harbor disease from fleas.
Along an apartment building, the squirrels had dug under a concrete slab and against the foundation. Nearby in a vacant lot, the rodents popped in and out of holes.
Ground squirrels near Pashone Grandson’s ground-level apartment dig holes near her door and eat her plants. One squirrel even got around her baby gate at the door and into her daughter’s clothes in her bedroom.

“It was a little scary. You don’t know what disease they carry. They’re dirty. I have a young daughter ... I didn’t know if it was going to bite her,” Grandson said.
North of town, Minot Air Force Base, which houses bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles, has fought the ground squirrels for years. Earlier this month, the base said it had trapped more than 800 “dak-rats,” a base name for the rodents.
Base officials declined to comment on the squirrels.
Jared Edwards, facilities director for Minot Public Schools, which has three schools on the base, said residential areas of the base and runways are overrun by ground squirrels. He called it “a continuous battle for them for the last 75 years since the base has been there.”
“I’m not going to exaggerate: They’re by the millions out there,” Edwards said.
In town, three school properties have large populations of ground squirrels, he said. Last year, the school system began using snares, and for years before that had used poison.
“It’s something you have to keep up with. It is Mother Nature,” Edwards said, adding that they’ve probably been in the area since homesteaders came through.
A cute nuisance
Still, not everyone sees the squirrels as a pest. Some find the critters cute and fuzzy.
Herman said people have sabotaged, stolen or thrown out his traps. They occasionally confront him when he shoots at ground squirrels with an air rifle, scolding him for hurting the wildlife, he said.
“They get that cute association, and they are, you know, adorable, but they’re a vermin and a pest and dangerous when they are allowed to proliferate,” Herman said.",https://apnews.com/author/jack-dura,2025-07-17T03:57:13,,,,,,,2025-09-11T15:56:09

(AP) — Nestled in forests around the world, a gentle army of
giant wooden trolls
want to show humans how to live better without destroying the planet.
The Danish recycle artist Thomas Dambo and his team have created 170 troll sculptures from discarded materials such as wooden pallets, old furniture and wine barrels.
Twelve years after he started the “Trail of a Thousand Trolls” project, his sculptures can be found in more than 20 countries and 21 U.S. states. Each year Dambo and his team make about 25 new trolls, which stand up to 40 feet (12 meters) tall.
“I believe that we can make anything out of anything,” said Dambo, speaking from his farm outside Copenhagen. “We are drowning in trash. But we also know that one man’s trash is another man’s treasure.”

An installation of six sculptures called “Trolls Save the Humans” is on display at Filoli, a historic estate with 650 acres of forests and gardens in Woodside, California, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of San Francisco.
“They bring us back to be connected to the earth and to nature,” said Jeannette Weederman, who was visiting Filoli with her son in July.
Dambo’s trolls each have their own personality and story. At Filoli, the troll Ibbi Pip builds birdhouses, Rosa Sunfinger plants flowers and Kamma Can makes jewelry from people’s garbage.
“Each of them has a story to tell,” said Filoli CEO Kara Newport. “It inspires people to think of their own stories, what kind of creatures might live in their woods and make that connection to living beings in nature.”
Dambo’s trolls don’t like humans because they waste nature’s resources and pollute the planet. The mythical creatures have a long-term perspective because they live for thousands of years and have witnessed the destructive force of human civilizations.
But the six young trolls at Filoli have a more optimistic view of human nature. They believe they can teach people how to protect the environment.
“They want to save the humans. So they do this by teaching them how to be better humans — be humans that don’t destroy nature,” said Dambo, 45, a poet and former hip-hop artist. “They hope to save them from being eaten by the older trolls.”

Dambo’s trolls are hidden in forests, mountains, jungles and grasslands throughout Europe and
North America
as well as countries such as Australia, Chile and South Korea. Most were built with local materials and assembled on-site by his team of craftsmen and artists with help from local volunteers.
“My exhibition now has four and a half million visitors a year globally, and it’s all made out of trash together with volunteers,” said Dambo. “That is such a huge proof of concept of why we should not throw things out, but why we should recycle it.”",https://apnews.com/author/terry-chea,2025-07-23T03:51:10,,,,,,,2025-09-11T15:56:11

(AP) — Two fishermen are safe after a whale crashed onto their boat, capsizing it off the New Hampshire shore, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.
The incident occurred Tuesday near Odiorne Point State Park in Rye. The two men, who were thrown overboard, said they had seen the whale earlier and were trying to keep their distance.
“He went under, he disappeared for a few minutes, and then the next thing we know, he just popped right up on our transom,” fisherman Ryland Kenney
told WMUR-TV
.
The Coast Guard posted to X that they had received a mayday call stating that a 23-foot (7-meter) center console boat had turned over because of a whale breach.
“The occupants were ejected from the vessel as the boat capsized,” the Coast Guard posted, adding that an urgent marine information broadcast was issued and the Coast Guard Station Portsmouth Harbor was alerted.
“A good Samaritan recovered both individuals from the water. No injuries were reported,” the Coast Guard posted.
The rescuers turned out to be two young brothers.
“I saw it come up, and I was just like, ‘Oh, it’s going to hit the boat,’” Wyatt Yager told the station. “It started to flip.” His brother, Colin Yager, caught what happened on his phone.
The boat crew from Station Portsmouth reported that the whale appeared not to be injured. The incident was reported to the Center of Coastal Studies Marine Animal Hotline and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The vessel has also been salvaged.
The whale probably did not know the boat was there, said Sara Morris of the University of New Hampshire Shoals Marine Laboratory.
“If you look at the video really carefully, you can see that the whale has its mouth open,” she told the station. “It looks like it’s lunge feeding and actually trying to catch fish.”",https://apnews.com/author/associated-press,2024-07-23T22:47:39,,,,,,,2025-09-11T15:56:13

But he can afford it","GENEVA (AP) — The driver was clocked going 27 kilometers per hour (17 mph) over the speed limit on a street in the Swiss city of Lausanne, and now he’s facing up to 90,000 Swiss francs (over $110,000) in fines as a result. But he can afford it.
Why the eye-popping penalty? Because the speedster, a repeat offender, is one of Switzerland’s wealthiest people, and the Vaud canton, or region, serves up fines based on factors like income, fortune or general family financial situation.
The Swiss are not alone. Germany, France, Austria and the
Nordic countries
all issue punishments based on a person’s wealth. The recent fine isn’t even a record in Switzerland. In 2010, a millionaire Ferrari driver got a ticket equal to about $290,000 for speeding in the eastern canton of St. Gallen.
Back then, the Swiss safety group Road Cross said rich drivers had been lightly punished until voters approved a penal law overhaul three years earlier that let judges hand down fines based on personal income and wealth for misdemeanors like speeding and drunk driving.
Under today’s rules, an indigent person might spend a night in jail instead of a fine, while the wealthiest in the rich Alpine country could be on the hook for tens of thousands.
A court in the Swiss canton of Vaud recently ruled that the tycoon must pay 10,000 Swiss francs ($12,300) up front and could be forced to pay the rest — 80,000 more — if he’s caught for a similar roadway infraction over the next three years.
Switzerland’s “24 Heures” newspaper first reported the case and said the man, who was not identified, was a French citizen listed by Swiss economic weekly Bilan among the 300 richest people in Switzerland — with a fortune in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
The daily reported that an automated police radar photographed the offender driving at 77 kilometers per hour (48 mph) in a 50 kph (31 mph) zone on a Lausanne street. A quick-calculating prosecutor tallied the maximum fine the driver faced under the law, the report said.
Vincent Derouand, a spokesperson for the Vaud public prosecutors office, said the defendant didn’t contest the decision, which was handed down in June for the infraction nearly a year ago — in August 2024.
The Vaud criminal code sets a maximum financial penalty based on the “personal and economic situation of the offender at the time of the ruling” — notably taking into account issues like income, fortune, lifestyle and family financial needs.
The newspaper reported that he had already been caught for a similar speeding infraction eight years ago, and also paid 10,000 Swiss francs in penalty and faced another 60,000 if another infraction had taken place within the following two years.
In Switzerland, penalties for speeding can even catch up with the cops: One officer
was fined for racing at nearly twice the speed limit
through Geneva streets back in 2016 while chasing thieves who had blown up a bank teller machine.",https://apnews.com/author/jamey-keaten,2025-08-12T16:28:24,,,,,,,2025-09-11T15:56:15

NIKOLAUS, Germany (AP) — Santa’s elves start early in Germany.
Three postal workers set off Saturday on their nearly 3,000-kilometer (1,860-mile) bicycle journey from St. Nikolaus, Germany, to the small town of Rovaniemi, Finland, which is home to
Santa Claus Village
, according to German news agency dpa.
The cyclists are traveling north to bring letters and Christmas wish lists addressed to Santa Claus from St. Nikolaus, in Germany’s Saarland state, to the
winter-themed amusement park
perched on the edge of the Arctic Circle.
St. Nikolaus himself, with his long purple cape and a tall golden staff, was on hand Saturday to hand over the letters to the three elves. The trip will take roughly two weeks as the three cycle through Germany, Denmark and Sweden en route to Finland, dpa reported.
The group is among the
Deutsche Post volunteers
who answer letters from children worldwide — more than 30,000 annually — that are addressed to the St. Nikolaus post office, which has its own postal code.
The tradition dates back to 1967, and each reply features a special stamp.
The town of St. Nikolaus is one of seven places in Germany
with a Christmas-themed name
, all of which receive letters addressed to Santa Claus or Saint Nick.
This year, St. Nikolaus handed over his own wish list to the cyclists, dpa reported.

However, there were also gains for LGBTQ+ representation in some countries. Openly gay, bisexual and transgender people ran for office in at least 36 countries, including for the first time in
Botswana
, Namibia and Romania – albeit unsuccessfully – according to the report by Outright International. The number of LGBTQ+ elected officials doubled to at least 233 in Brazil.
As the visibility of LGBTQ+ people has risen in many countries in the last decade, so too has a backlash from conservative parts of societies, fuelled in many cases by far-right activists and politicians using gay and transgender people as scapegoats for other problems.
There is a growing “weaponisation of hate”, said Alberto de Belaúnde, a director at Outright International, an NGO that promotes LGBTQ+ rights globally.
He said: “You talk with a politician from Peru … or
Hungary
or the UK, you start to see common trends and you realise that it’s a global, coordinated and increasingly well-funded effort to diminish LGBTIQ people.”
LGBTQ+ candidates for office were subject to online hate speech from election opponents and their supporters in El Salvador, Finland, Pakistan and the US, where Sarah McBride was elected as the
first transgender member of the House of Representatives
.
During the 2024 US elections, Republican campaigns spent $200m (£147.5m) on anti-transgender adverts on network TV (not including cable TV or streaming), according to
data
from advert tracking firm AdImpact.
In the campaign for parliamentary elections in the former Soviet republic of Georgia in October 2024, the
ruling Georgian Dream party
claimed that LGBTQ+ activists were “foreign agents” of the west, out to corrupt the country’s “traditional values”.
During election campaigns in Ghana, where gay sex is criminalised under a colonial-era law, both of the two main parties said they would protect “family values” while accusing the other of being pro-LGBTQ+.
Before the June 2024 EU elections, in which far-right parties
made big gains
, the Fidesz-KDNP coalition of the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, claimed that the “Brussels elite and the Soros network, fattened up with EU money, are waging an ideological war: re-educating our children with gender propaganda.” In Germany, the far-right
Alternative für Deutschland
said it was against “other forms of cohabitation than between a man and a woman” being treated equally.
In
Indonesia
, which voted in February 2024, the National Human Rights Commission condemned reports that politicians had vowed to “eradicate LGBT”. And while all three main parties in Pakistan promised to respect the rights of transgender people, trans candidates reported being verbally harassed in person as well as online on the campaign trail for the February 2024 vote.
The Outright International report said that rises in discrimination against minorities had come hand in hand with growing authoritarianism: “In 2024, as in previous years, LGBTIQ communities and other marginalised groups were among the first casualties of these anti-democratic attacks.”",https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rachel-savage,2025-09-11T04:01:22.000Z,,,,,,,2025-09-11T15:56:33

Steve Biko
, nearly 50 years after he died in police custody.
Biko, the founder of South Africa’s Black Consciousness Movement,
died in a prison cell in 1977 aged just 30
, after being beaten into a coma by police who had arrested him nearly a month earlier.
The death sparked outrage across the world and he became an international symbol of the struggle against the race-based apartheid system that denied South Africa’s black majority political and economic rights.
“The main goal of reopening the inquest is to lay before the court evidence that will enable the court to make a finding … as to whether the death was brought about by any act, or omission, which prima facie involves or amounts to an offence on the part of any person,” the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said on Wednesday.
The case will be reopened on the 48th anniversary of Biko’s death on 12 September.
A 1977 inquest accepted the police account that Biko sustained injuries when he hit his head against the wall and no one was prosecuted for the death.
But in 1997, former police officers implicated in the case admitted assaulting the activist during hearings by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) into atrocities committed during the apartheid era.
The TRC refused to grant amnesty to the officers, ruling that they lied in their evidence and failed to prove a political motive for killing Biko.

crime-plagued area
of Cape Town, adding to the death toll in a city already reeling from the scourge of gang-related violence.
At 11.30pm on Monday, two women, aged 19 and 25, were killed and a 24-year-old woman injured in a shooting in Wallacedene, an informal settlement on Cape Town’s north-eastern edge,
South African police
said. About 10 minutes later, two other women in their 20s were killed by gunshots to the head in a bedroom in the same area, with police saying the deaths may be linked.
The suspected double murders came a day after those of a 20- and 22-year-old, whose genders were not disclosed by police, in neighbouring Eikendal.
On 5 September, a man was
shot dead
at a magistrates court in suspected gang violence, the
third killing
in a Cape Town court since April.
Cape Town is one of the most violent cities in one of the most violent countries in the world. The murder rate in South Africa is behind only Jamaica and Ecuador, according to
data
from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. Last year, Cape Town had the second highest murder rate of any municipality in South Africa, behind Nelson Mandela Bay, and the 16th highest globally, according to
Seguridad Justicia y Paz
, a Mexican NGO.
More than 2.4 million people visited Cape Town in 2024, according to
city authorities
, drawn by its beaches, mountains and nearby vineyards. However, the city is deeply divided between opulent suburbs and the poorer Cape Flats townships, where non-white people were forced to move in the years after the apartheid regime passed the Group Areas Act of 1950.
“Our communities are fearful,” Lynn Phillips, from the Cape Flats Safety Forum, told AFP last week at an anti-gang protest. “We don’t have to switch on Netflix to hear gun violence. We sleep, we eat, and we wake up with gun violence.”
Western Cape police said last week they were carrying out “targeted operations” in Cape Flats hotspots to seize firearms and ammunition. A statement said: “The message is clear: illegal firearms and those who profit from them have no place in our communities. Our operations will continue without fear or favour, until gangsterism and the violence associated with it are rooted out of the Western Cape.”
The acting police minister, Firoz Cachalia, told Cape Flats community members at a meeting on Tuesday that local police did not have the capabilities for “intelligence-driven operations” to successfully tackle gangs and organised crime,
local media reported
.
“There is no proper plan in Cape Town to deal with gang violence in the province,” said Cachalia, who is from the African National Congress party, while Cape Town and the Western Cape are run by their national coalition partners, the Democratic Alliance.

Cuba
suffered its fifth nationwide blackout in under a year, the energy ministry announced.
“There has been a total disconnection of the electric system,” the energy ministry and National Electric Union said early on Wednesday.
The grid failure follows
a string of nationwide blackouts
since late last year that plunged Cuba’s frail and antiquated power generation system into near-total disarray.
Earlier this week, an outage hit Cuba’s eastern region, leaving people from Las Tunas to Guantánamo in the dark for several hours.
In February, the government suspended classes and work activities for two days given a shortage in electricity generation.
“This is crazy for everything,” Raúl Ernesto Gutiérrez said in Havana.
Gutiérrez, who said he was visiting the capital, said that back home in the countryside, “we will have to cook with charcoal, with firewood. It’s stressful and also frustrating.”
The country has also being facing fuel, food and other shortages amid its worst economic crisis in decades.
Havana state worker Danai Hernández, said she was on the way home from work which had just shut down.
“I’m going home to organize everything in the household and … now we have to wait. We don’t have any other choice,” she said, visibly upset.
Cuba’s oil-fired power plants, already obsolete and struggling to keep the lights on, reached a full crisis last year as oil imports from Venezuela, Russia and Mexico dwindled.
In October 2024, the island, which is suffering its worst economic crisis in three decades, was plunged into darkness for several days following a shutdown of the Antonio Guiteras thermoelectric power plant, the island’s biggest.
Cuba’s energy crisis has worsened in recent years due to US sanctions intended to put pressure on the island to change its political model.
The sanctions have prevented the Caribbean country from having sufficient foreign currency to buy fuel or repair its ageing thermoelectric plants, many of which have been operating for more than 30 years.

Alexandre de Moraes was the first supreme court justice of five to announce his decision on Tuesday, as the trial of Bolsonaro and seven alleged co-conspirators – including four senior members of the military and the former head of Brazil’s answer to MI6 – entered its final stretch.
“The defendant, Jair Bolsonaro, was leader of this criminal structure,” the judge told a courtroom in the capital, Brasília, during a five-hour speech detailing what he called Bolsonaro’s “authoritarian project”.
Bolsonaro has denied involvement in a coup plot. But Moraes said there was “ample evidence” that the far-right populist, who governed the South American country from 2019 until the end of 2022, had
tried to cling to power
after losing that year’s election to his leftwing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
“Brazil nearly went back to being a dictatorship … because a criminal organisation made up of a political group doesn’t know how to lose elections​,” Moraes told the court​. “Because a criminal organisation made up of a political group led by Jair Bolsonaro doesn’t understand that the alternation of power is a principle of republican democracy.”​
Later in the day, a second judge, Flávio Dino, also voted for Bolsonaro and his alleged accomplices to be found guilty, although Dino argued that some of the defendants had higher levels of culpability than others. Bolsonaro’s level of guilt was “rather high”, the judge claimed, indicating he would support a tougher sentence for the former president.
Three more supreme court justices are due to cast their votes in the coming days, with Bolsonaro’s conviction widely considered a foregone conclusion. If found guilty of crimes including leading an armed criminal organisation and a coup d’etat and violently attempting to abolish Brazil’s democracy, the former president faces a sentence of up to 43 years. A verdict is expected by Thursday. While Bolsonaro has denied the charges, he has admitted seeking supposedly constitutional ways of remaining in power.
Explaining his vote, Moraes claimed the alleged coup plot began in June 2021, the third year of Bolsonaro’s government, when the then president and close allies launched a deliberate and criminal attempt to undermine Brazil’s electronic voting system and intimidate its judiciary by spreading “criminal lies” through a huge campaign of online disinformation. Their goal was to convince millions of Brazilians of the possibility of election fraud and justify an illegal power grab if Bolsonaro lost the presidential election in October 2022.
The conspiracy allegedly accelerated in November 2022, after Bolsonaro was narrowly defeated by Lula. In a series of post-election meetings with the leaders of the armed forces, Bolsonaro allegedly tried to convince them to stage a military intervention to prevent Lula from taking power. The head of the navy, who is also on trial this week, allegedly agreed while the army and air force commanders declined to take part. Moraes said the latter two deserved “respect and admiration” for helping thwart Bolsonaro’s alleged coup attempt.
At the same time, a parallel plot to cause social chaos by using a hit squad of special forces assassins to murder Lula, the vice-president-elect, Geraldo Alckmin, and Moraes also began to unfold, although it was allegedly aborted at the last minute.
That subplot – a copy of which Moraes said was printed out at the presidential palace by an army general and then delivered to the presidential residence – was supposedly intended to justify the imposition of a state of exception that would allow Bolsonaro to retain power.
“This [plan] wasn’t printed out in a cave. It wasn’t printed out hidden away in a room of terrorists. It was printed out in the presidential palace. It was printed out in the seat of the Brazilian government,” Moraes told the court, adding that he was certain Bolsonaro was aware of the plan. It was impossible to believe that the general who printed out the roadmap for the assassinations and took it to the presidential residence did so with the intention of using the document to make “a paper boat”, Moraes said.
The failed putsch allegedly culminated on 8 January 2023, one week after Lula’s inauguration, when hardcore Bolsonaro supporters ran riot in Brasília, vandalising the presidential palace, the congressional building and the supreme court building where this week’s trial is being held.
Bolsonaro has denied inciting those attacks, noting how he had flown to the US at the end of December 2022 to avoid having to hand the presidential sash to Lula. But Moraes rejected the former president’s attempts to distance himself from the violence. “When the mafia foot soldier commits a crime on the orders of the mafia capo, the head of the criminal organisation isn’t [physically] there. But he answers for [the crime] because he ordered it,” Moraes said.
“What happened on 8 January was not spontaneous combustion,” Moraes added. Rather, he said, it was the conclusion of a long-running plot to stay in power “at any cost” carried out by “a political group that, regrettably, transformed itself into a criminal organisation”.
That organisation of “criminal coup mongers”, led by Bolsonaro, hoped “to keep itself in power irrespective of the result of the elections”, Moraes said.
The judge also voted for the seven other defendants to be convicted. They include the former defence ministers Gen Walter Braga Netto and Gen Paulo Sérgio Nogueira de Oliveira, the former minister for institutional security Gen Augusto Heleno, and the former navy commander Adm Almir Garnier Santos. The conviction of that quartet of military men would represent a historic moment for Brazil, where members of the military top brass have never before been held to account for staging a coup. All four men deny being part of the alleged power grab.
​Bolsonaro is under house arrest and did not attend Tuesday’s hearing. But his senator son, Flávio Bolsonaro​, said there was “no proof at all” of his father’s guilt and called claims that his father was involved in a plot to murder Moraes, Lula and Alckmin “fiction”.",https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tomphillips,2025-09-09T21:30:45.000Z,,,,,,,2025-09-11T15:56:41

bees
” as they raided her shop in a brazen attempt to steal honey.
Christine McDonald, who owns Rushing River Apiaries in the British Columbia city of Terrace, said she entered her shop to find it overrun by the swarm.
“I think that’s the most panicked I have felt … There’s thousands of bees, I don’t know where they’re coming from, and I need to protect all of the honey,” she told CBC News.
Raids of rival hives are common after hot, dry summers, when a “nectar gap” emerges between spring blooms and autumn flowers. Larger bee colonies also need more food to collect and store.
“Fall beekeeping is very intense – trying to help bees hunker down against other bees and wasps and keep the food stores that they’ve worked so hard for,” said McDonald, who has previously seen raids on her outdoor hives – but never on her store.
Experts warn against attempting to stop a “robbing frenzy” and suggest covering hives with wet blankets to ward off invaders.
“When a hive is robbed, the invading bees kill bees and may even kill the queen. They tear open wax cells to get at the honey inside and can remove large amounts of honey very quickly,”
said one beekeeping guide
. “Worse, ripping open cells spreads the smell of honey far and wide, which attracts other invaders like wasps, yellow jackets, and hornets. These insects are even more aggressive, and will promptly kill off any bees left in the hive.”
McDonald says she avoided disaster by throwing a tarp over the equipment and products, but ended up “sacrificing her bathroom” in order to trap the invading bees.
By leaving the lights on in the room, she lured the bees away from their target. McDonald later scoured the shop in search of ingress points, discovering that the bees had entered through a gap in the door frame, which has since been sealed.
She said it took four or five days before the ravenous bees stopped trying to return to her shop.
“I think they’ve learned that, nope, there’s no more food here,” she said. “We can’t get in.”",https://www.theguardian.com/profile/leyland-cecco,2025-09-09T17:45:02.000Z,,,,,,,2025-09-11T15:56:43

Hong Kong
government of failing to provide the “bare minimum” of rights to same-sex couples after it rejected a bill that was introduced to comply with an order by the city’s top court.
The city’s unicameral legislative council (LegCo), on Wednesday rejected the bill by a vote of 71-14 after the second reading, following months of debate in the city between opponents who said it threatened family values and advocates who said the government was out of line with the majority of residents who supported same-sex relationships.
The bill, which would have given limited rights to couples whose marriage or civil union was registered overseas, was in answer to a September 2023 ruling by the court of final appeal. The landmark case,
brought by activist Jimmy Sham
, affirmed that the city’s laws defined marriage as between a man and a woman, but also said the government was obliged
to create an “alternative framework”
which recognised the “core rights” of same-sex couples.
The resulting proposal was criticised at the time by advocates who said it was a “pained attempt” to comply while offering as little as possible. On Wednesday they criticised LegCo’s rejection of it.
Advocacy group, Hong Kong
Marriage
Equality, said the veto sent “a troubling signal to both local and international communities – that court rulings may be disregarded and the dignity of individuals overlooked.
“We commend the government for taking initial steps towards fulfilling its constitutional obligation to implement the court of final appeal’s decision on establishing a legal framework for the recognition of same-sex relationships.
“At the same time, we express our profound regret that lawmakers have chosen to ignore clear evidence and public sentiment.”
Amnesty International’s Nadia Rahman said the bill was “flawed”, and would have provided “the bare minimum of protection” only to couples who registered their relationship overseas, but its rejection showed “an alarming disdain for LGBTI rights”.
“It is a setback which shows just how far Hong Kong has to go before everyone in the city can enjoy equal rights,” said Rahman.
“All of our community feel very disappointed, but I still want everybody to have hope because this is not the endgame,” Sham said after the vote.
Wednesday’s vote was the first time a bill has been rejected by LegCo since an
electoral overhaul
by the Chinese government, designed to ensure only pro-Beijing “patriots” could run Hong Kong, effectively removed opposition.
During the lengthy debate some legislators said they were voting against the bill because it would affect the foundations of monogamous and heterosexual marriage in Hong Kong.
Lawmaker Holden Chow from the city’s biggest pro-establishment party said the bill’s passage would mean opening “a Pandora’s box”, and “subverting Hong Kong’s marriage system between one man and one woman”.
Junius Ho, a firebrand legislator known for incendiary views about the LGBTQ+ community, said the government should never have proposed the bill, and suggested increasing the rights of same sex couples would cause confusion on Mother’s Day and Fathers Day.
“Why do we still need to worry about imaginary troubles and do all this unorthodox stuff? To plunge an entire society into turmoil for a small minority of people?”
Among the 14 who voted in favour of the bill, lawmaker Regina Ip likened it to a “minimum spending” requirement, given the rights offered were limited.
Secretary for constitutional and mainland affairs Erick Tsang, said the government was disappointed that legislators vetoed the bill, but respected their decision which he said was on behalf of local residents and mainstream opinion.
Meanwhile Beijing officials said the decision proved that LegCo was not a “rubber stamp” parliament, as critics have called it since the electoral overhaul.
Polling has shown the majority of people in Hong Kong support same-sex relationships, and extensive lobbying by LGBTQ+ groups and a series of hard fought court cases have established some piecemeal rights, including those related to public housing, inheritance law
and spousal visas
.
Nick Infinger, a Hongkonger who previously succeeded in an LGBTQ+ rights legal bid, said the community had few other places to turn.
“Judicial review would be the only way that we can fight for our rights … little bit by little bit,” he said.
The court of final appeal gave the government a two-year deadline, which ends this month. In a statement the government said it wouldn’t apply for an extension, but would “further discuss and study the issue with the department of justice”.

Torrential rains beginning on Monday caused flooding and landslides in East Nusa Tenggara province and on the island of
Bali
.
Rescuers on Wednesday recovered the bodies of a mother and her child buried under mud in the worst-hit village of Mauponggo and a man in the neighbouring village of Loka laba in the Nagekeo district of East Nusa Tenggara, officials said.
Previously, three members of a family were found dead after their house was swept away and four people were missing in Mauponggo village.
In Bali, rescuers retrieved the body of a woman near the Badung market in the provincial capital of Denpasar late Wednesday, according to the National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesperson Abdul Muhari. He said rescuers were searching for six people still missing in the province.
Eight bodies were found earlier, including four people who were in a building that was swept away in the Kumbasari market area of South Denpasar, said Nyoman Sidakarya, the head of Bali’s Search and Rescue Agency.
Rain has caused rivers to burst their banks, tearing through nine cities and districts in Bali.
Mud, rocks and trees tumbled on to mountainside hamlets and rising rivers submerged at least 112 neighbourhoods and resulted in several landslides, Bali’s Disaster Mitigation Agency said in a statement.
Videos released by the National Search and Rescue Agency showed cars floating in muddy waters while soldiers and rescuers in rubber boats helped children and older people who were forced on to the roofs of flooded homes and buildings.

Severe flooding inundated thousands of homes and buildings in residential areas and tourist spots.
Authorities have cut electricity and water, prompting hotels, restaurants, hospitals and other public facilities to use generators, the Bali governor, Wayan Koster, said.
There have been landslides in 18 neighbourhoods of Karangasem, Gianyar and Badung districts and swept through at least 15 shops and houses and damaged several roads and bridges, he said.
“This disaster also caused material losses for traders and tourism businesses,” Koster said, adding that more than 800 people were in temporary shelters after flood water reached up to 2.5 metres in places.
The Local Disaster Mitigation Agency head, Agustinus Pone, said flash floods in Nagekeo swept away villagers and vehicles passing through devastated villages and triggered a landslide that blocked three roads, killing at least six villagers, and four people were missing.
The severe weather and rugged terrain hampered rescue efforts, and the flooding in Nagekeo also destroyed two bridges, two government offices, a plantation, rice fields and livestock, Muhari said.
Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said its consulate general in Bali stood ready to provide assistance to any Australian citizens affected by the flooding.
“DFAT’s travel advice for Indonesia continues to highlight the possibility of flooding during heavy rain, including in Bali,” a spokesperson said.

‘No one was getting through’
Philipp Peltz, 49, a German music producer who had been visiting Canggu in Bali, had a flight booked to leave Denpasar on Wednesday afternoon.
“No taxis would pick me up, the roads were flooded and no one was getting through,” he said, speaking from Thailand.
He eventually rode his scooter to the airport, at times pushing it through waist-high flood waters.
“It took three-and-a-half hours, but I made it, soaked through. As always, the Balinese people were helping each other out, there was no panic,” he said.
He said the floods had reignited ongoing local debate about the impacts of tourism infrastructure development and climate change.
“I’ve been visiting Bali for more than a decade and I have never seen flooding like this,” he said.
Dedians Jebarus, a tour operator based in Canggu, said his sister’s home in Dalung, near Denpasar, had been flooded but that his relatives were safe.
On Thursday, the sun was shining in Denpasar, he said.
“Today is back to normal,” he said.

The US president made the demand during a meeting between US and EU officials discussing options to increase economic pressure on
Russia
on Tuesday, according to a White House official.
One US official
told the Financial Times
that Trump administration was “ready to go, ready to go right now, but we are only going to do this if our European partners step up with us”.
Trump’s proposal comes amid his frustration at brokering a peace deal, including at a
high-profile summit with Putin in Alaska
, and amid Russia’s increasing drone attacks, including its
largest ever air attack on Ukraine
last week.
After the meeting in Washington, Trump told reporters he expected to have a call with the Russian president “this week or early next week”.
The move by Trump follows Putin strengthening his relationship with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, and India’s prime minister, Narenda Modi,
at a showpiece summit in China.
Last month, the US increased tariffs on Indian imports to 50% in
response to the country’s purchases of Russian oil.
On Tuesday, Trump wrote on his social media platform that trade negotiations with
India
would proceed.
“India, and the United States of America, are continuing negotiations to address the Trade Barriers between our two Nations,” he wrote on Truth Social. “I look forward to speaking with my very good friend, Prime Minister Modi, in the upcoming weeks. I feel certain that there will be no difficulty in coming to a successful conclusion for both of our Great Countries!”
EU officials, led by the bloc’s sanctions chief, David O’Sullivan, participated in the discussions in Washington, which featured senior US treasury officials.
News of the discussions came as Mexico announced it would raise its tariffs on automobiles from
China
and other Asian countries to 50%, from a prior level of 20%.
The economy minister, Marcelo Ebrard, said the move was intended to protect jobs in Mexico.
The pressure on the EU from Trump comes at a pivotal moment for his tariff policies. In May, the
US trade court ruled
that the tariffs “exceed any authority granted to the president”. A federal appeals court
upheld
that ruling at the end of August, and the case is now heading to the supreme court.
The supreme court hearing is set to hear the case in the first week in November and the tariffs remain in place ahead of its ruling. But the uncertain future of Trump’s tariffs has complicated the administration’s negotiations with trading nations and threatens to leave the US with a huge bill should the court rule against them.
On Sunday, Scott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, said he was “confident” that the administration would win its case at the supreme court, although
legal experts are divided
and the lower courts have consistently ruled against them.
Bessent has said the US would have to refund tens of billions of dollars in tariffs should the court rule them illegal. “We would have to give a refund on about half the tariffs, which would be terrible for the treasury,” Bessent said in an interview Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press.","https://www.theguardian.com/profile/marksweney,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dominic-rushe",2025-09-10T15:59:45.000Z,,,,,,,2025-09-11T15:56:51

#MeToo movement
.
Choi Mal-ja was 19 in 1964 when she was attacked by a 21-year-old man in the southern town of Gimhae. He pinned her to the ground and repeatedly forced his tongue into her mouth, at one point blocking her nose to stop her from breathing, according to court records.
Choi managed to break free by biting off 1.5cm of his tongue.
In one of South Korea’s most contentious rulings on sexual violence, the aggressor received only six months in prison, suspended for two years, for trespassing and intimidation – but not attempted rape.
Choi, now 79, was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm and handed a 10-month prison sentence, suspended for two years. That decision was overturned on Wednesday by the Busan district court which ruled her actions constituted “justifiable self-defence” under South Korean law.
Choi’s actions at the time are now “deemed an attempt to escape an unjust infringement on her bodily integrity and sexual self-determination”, the court said in a statement.
The ruling overturns Choi’s 1965 conviction, when the court found her actions had “exceeded the reasonable bounds of legally permissible self-defence”.
Choi smiled as supporters handed her bouquets of flowers after the ruling. Women’s rights activists and supporters celebrated, waving a placard that read: “Choi Mal-ja did it!”
In a press conference after the ruling, Choi said: “Sixty-one years ago, in a situation where I could understand nothing, the victim became the perpetrator and my fate was sealed as a criminal. For the victims who shared the same fate as mine, I wanted to be a source of hope for them.”
Choi’s appeal gained momentum after the #MeToo movement that took off in 2017 inspired her to seek justice. In South Korea, women’s rights protests have led to victories on issues ranging from abortion access to tougher penalties for spycam crimes.
Choi filed for a retrial in 2020, but lower courts initially rejected her petition.
After years of campaigning and an appeal, South Korea’s highest court finally ordered a retrial in 2024. At its first hearing,
prosecutors apologised to Choi
and asked the court to overturn her conviction.
Her lawyers said they plan to seek compensation from the state for the damages she suffered from her conviction six decades ago.",Agence France-Press in Seoul,2025-09-10T12:56:42.000Z,,,,,,,2025-09-11T15:56:53

New Zealand
police said on Wednesday as they released images that show a newly discovered campsite.
Phillips had spent nearly four years hiding in the wilderness with his three children. He was
killed in an exchange of fire
with police after reports of a burglary in the remote town of Piopio, in the central North Island, on Monday.
Later on Monday, two of his children were found safe and well at a campsite in Waitomo. It is understood the third child was with Phillips at the time of the shooting.
After identifying what they believe to be Phillips’ main campsite for the last few months, police said it appeared he had received outside assistance.
“We are currently looking at a number of items at the site. Aside from the burglaries we are now able to link to Tom, it is apparent that he had outside help,” said detective senior sergeant Andrew Saunders.
“As the investigation has been going on, we’ve always suspected Tom Phillips has been receiving help,” Saunders said.
Police would now open a new investigation to identify anyone who helped Phillips. Objects found at the campsite would be analysed to see if they could be linked to burglaries or had been purchased for Phillips.
“We think it’s absolutely important that we continue to look for those people that have been supporting Tom Phillips and hold them accountable.”
Images of the campsite released by New Zealand police on Wednesday.

The pictures released on Wednesday show a campsite found roughly 200m from the site where his children were discovered, police said in a statement.
The images show a steep incline where tarpaulins have been erected among the trees. Camouflage netting covers one corner of a large structure. Inside the campsite is a gas cylinder, a portable stove top, large buckets, gumboots and a tent that looks to be set into a dugout area.
It was difficult to access, well-hidden and highlighted the challenging environment the family used as its base, they said.
“It’s a very grim, dimly-lit area, surrounded by dense bush. The tent was well covered and dry,” said detective Saunders.
The campsite was “very dirty”, cramped and “not very nice for children”, he told media on Wednesday afternoon.
The site was likely Phillips’ main campsite in recent months but not necessarily the primary place the family had lived in since they vanished, Saunders said.
Images released on Tuesday
showed the campsite where two of Phillips’ children were found. Police said at least one firearm and ammunition were discovered at the campsite, about 2km from where Phillips had been killed. A police officer is recovering in hospital after being shot in the head by Phillips with a high-powered rifle in the standoff.

expressed concern
about the children’s reintegration into society.
The children’s’ mother, Cat, told Radio New Zealand’s Mata programme that she did not yet know when she would be reunited with her children.
Police minister Mark Mitchell told Mata it was a “complex situation”.
The children are now in child protective custody. An urgent suppression order was granted in the high court in relation to aspects of the case on Tuesday evening after an application by a lawyer acting on behalf of the Phillips family.

TikTok
was responsible for “endangering the lives” of its young users.
Arthur Delaporte, a Socialist MP, said he co-chaired a six-month French parliamentary inquiry into TikTok’s psychological effects on minors and heard testimony from families, social media executives and influencers.
He told the broadcaster
FranceInfo
: “The conclusion is clear: TikTok has deliberately endangered the health and lives of its users. That is why I have decided to refer the matter to the Paris public prosecutor.
“It seems to me that there are offences of a criminal nature, of active complicity, and secondly, when TikTok executives came to see us, they told us that they were unaware of anything … and I believe that this also constitutes perjury.”
It is now up to the prosecutor to decide whether or not to open an investigation into the popular short video platform.
The French parliamentary committee was set up to examine TikTok and its psychological effects on young people after a 2024 French lawsuit against the platform by seven families who accused it of exposing their children to content that was pushing them towards ending their lives.
The parliament committee’s
final report
, published on Thursday, found that TikTok was like a “slow poison” to children. The co-head of the inquiry, centrist lawmaker Laure Miller, told France Info that TikTok was an “ocean of harmful content” that was very visible to children through algorithms that kept them in a bubble.
The report recommended that children under 15 in
France
should be banned entirely from using social media, and those aged between 15 and 18 should face a night-time “digital curfew”, meaning social media would be made unavailable to them between 10pm and 8am.
The report also called for a major public information campaign and a new offence of “digital negligence” for “irresponsible parents” who did not oversee their children’s use of social media.
Delaporte told France Info that making those recommendations was a way of starting a debate in society. He said: “The main issue is European regulation and how we can force platforms to modify their algorithm.”
A TikTok spokesperson said: “We categorically reject the commission’s misleading characterisation of our platform that attempts to scapegoat our company on industry-wide and societal challenges. TikTok has an ongoing, robust trust and safety programme with more than 70 features and settings designed specifically to support the safety and wellbeing of teens and families on our platform.”
Executives for TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, told the French parliamentary committee that the app used AI-enhanced moderation that last year caught 98% of content infringing its terms of service in France.
Emmanuel Macron’s office had indicated it wanted to see a social media ban for children and young adolescents, after
Australia
last year started drafting its own landmark law with a prohibition for those under 16.
Géraldine, whose 18-year-old daughter ended her life, told Agence France-Presse that, after her daughter’s death last year, she had discovered videos of self-harm her daughter had published and looked at on TikTok.
“TikTok didn’t kill our little girl, because she wasn’t well in any case,” she said. But she accused TikTok of falling short in its online moderation, and plunging her daughter deeper into her dark impulses.

New French PM Sébastien Lecornu promises ‘profound break’ with past politics
in Paris
The new French prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu, has promised a “profound break” with past politics
as he took over from the unpopular centrist François Bayrou, who was
ousted this week
over a proposed budget squeeze.

Lecornu, 39, who said “humility” was the key approach, now faces the difficult task of gaining enough support from France’s divided parliament to pass a budget
if he is to avoid being swiftly ousted
in the same way as Bayrou
, and before him, the rightwing
Michel Barnier
, who only lasted three months.
“We will get there … no path is impossible,”
Lecornu said on Wednesday.
Lecornu is
the third French prime minister in only one year
as the country has gone through a period of instability and
political crisis
since the centrist president, Emmanuel Macron, called an inconclusive snap election last year.
The parliament remains divided
between the three blocs: the left, the far right and the centre, with no clear majority. A budget for next year must be agreed within the coming weeks, even though the political parties are at loggerheads.
Let’s also quickly take a look at the job ahead for the new French prime minister,
Sébastien Lecornu.

RTÉ says Ireland will not be part of Eurovision 2026 if Israel participates

This report comes after
Ireland’s national broadcaster, RTÉ, has decided not to take part in next year’s
Eurovision
song contest if Israel is a participant.

RTÉ is
the second of 37 broadcasters who took part in the event this year to have made participation next year conditional.
“It is
RTÉ’s position that
Ireland
will not take part in the 2026 Eurovision song contest if the participation of Israel goes ahead,
and the final decision regarding Ireland’s participation will be made once the EBU’s decision is made,” the broadcaster said in a statement.
“RTÉ feels that
Ireland’s participation would be unconscionable given the ongoing and appalling loss of lives in Gaza.
RTÉ is also deeply concerned by the targeted killing of journalists in Gaza, and the denial of access to international journalists to the territory, and the plight of the remaining hostages.”
The
decision will raise questions about its duty to be impartial as a public service news organisation.
Slovenia’s national broadcaster, RTVSLO, has also said it will participate in next year’s contest only if Israel is not involved.
This week
the Spanish culture minister said Spain should not take part either.
In an interview with the Spanish TV programme
La Hora de la 1 on Monday
, Ernest Urtasun said: “We asked for Israel to be expelled from Eurovision [earlier this year],” he said.
The Eurovision song contest will take place in Vienna next May
and is the world’s second biggest TV event, with more than 160 million viewers.
EU insists it will take action on Israel, dismissing 'lip service' criticism
In other news,
the European Commission has insisted that
Ursula von der Leyen’s promise to take action on Gaza was not just lip service to critics of the EU’s inaction
, promising the proposal to partially suspend the EU/Israel trade association agreement would come “soon”.
Von der Leyen yesterday said it would suspend its “bilateral support” with Israel and partially suspend the trade parts of the EU Israel association agreement
in a move that was seen as a response to mounting criticism that the EU was failing to use its leverage with the Israel government over starvation and killings of civilians in Gaza.
The
commission refused to go into details of the moves or the timeline
under persistent questioning by reporters in Brussels on Thursday.
Asked how they could convince sceptics that the lack of detail signified inaction, the commission’s deputy spokesperson
Olof Gill
said this was not the case.
“I can reassure you that the commission’s proposals relating to trade related matters in the EU-Israel Association Agreement will come soon.”
A spokesperson on foreign affairs said th
e Commission was also looking at “nine individuals and five entities linked to violent extremists in the West Bank and East Jerusalem
” but discussion on potential sanctions were “ongoing and confidential”.
Germany to expand and extend air policing over Poland after drone incursion
Germany will strengthen its presence in Nato’s eastern flank in response to the incursion of Russian drones into Poland
, extending and expanding its air policing over Poland, a government spokesperson said.
In comments reported by Reuters, he added that
Berlin would also intensify support for
Ukraine
and work within the EU towards the swift adoption of a 19th sanctions package
against Russia.

Polish foreign ministry spokesperson
Paweł Wroński

He said that eight Belarusian journalists working for Polish media outlets, including Belsat TV, were also released.
The group was en-route to Lithuania and further details will be released only after they have met with Polish diplomats expecting them in Vilnius.

Zelenskyy urges Nato allies to rethink air defence capabilities after Poland drone incursion
Ukrainian president
Volodymyr Zelenskyy
urged Kyiv’s allies to rethink their own air defence capabilities after incursions into Polish airspace by drones
that Warsaw said were Russian, Reuters reported.
Zelenskiy said
countries such as
Poland
should explore similar multi-layered approaches
as missile systems such as the US-made Patriot were too expensive to use against cheaper drones used by Russia.
“No one in the world has enough missiles to shoot down all different types of drones,” Zelenskyy said.","https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jakub-krupa,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tom-ambrose,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/angeliquechrisafis,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lisaocarroll,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ajit-niranjan",2025-09-11T15:36:11.000Z,,,,,,,2025-09-11T15:57:00

incursion into the country by Russian drones on Wednesday
as allies disputed whether it was a deliberate attack on Poland by Russia and Donald Trump offered little in the way of public support.
Poland’s foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, told local radio Poland planned to use the security council meeting to “draw the world’s attention to this unprecedented Russian drone attack on a member of the UN, EU and Nato”.
He added that Polish authorities had no doubt the act was deliberate. “Nineteen violations of our airspace, several dozen drones identified, a few shot down, the action lasting seven hours, the whole night – so we cannot say it was an accident,” he said.
Sikorski and his Ukrainian and Lithuanian counterparts issued a statement calling the incursion a “deliberate and coordinated attack” and an “unprecedented provocation”.
However, Alexus Grynkewich, Nato’s supreme allied commander
Europe
, said at a briefing on Thursday that it was still unclear whether the incursion was deliberate. “We do not yet know if this was an intentional act or an unintentional act,” he said. He added that he had “low confidence” in Poland’s claims about the number of drones.
“I would not be able to tell you with any confidence today that it was 20 or that it was 10. We just have to get into the technical details to figure that out, to debrief the crews that were up see what they saw,” he said.
Russia has claimed its drones were not targeting
Poland
, but the defence ministry did not confirm or deny Russian drones were involved. On Thursday, Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia would make no further comment on the incident.
As European leaders rushed to condemn the Russian incursion and pledge allied support, the initial response from Trump was ambiguous. “What’s with Russia violating Poland’s airspace with drones? Here we go!” he wrote on social media, without condemning the attack.

Late on Wednesday, Poland’s nationalist president, Karol Nawrocki, who visited Trump in the White House last week, said that he and Trump had spoken by phone and “confirmed allied unity”, without giving further details.
The US ambassador to
Nato
, Matthew Whitaker, offered a more reassuring message for Warsaw. “We stand by our Nato allies in the face of these airspace violations and will defend every inch of Nato territory,” he wrote on X.
Since Putin and Trump met in Alaska last month, Russia has continued almost nightly air assaults on
Ukraine
and there is little sign that a ceasefire or peace deal is on the horizon. Many in Europe see the incursion into Poland as Russia testing the limits of Nato solidarity under Trump. Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, said the incident brought Poland closer to military conflict “than at any time since the second world war”.
On Thursday morning, Finland’s president, Alexander Stubb, arrived by train to Kyiv, where he was due to meet with Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Stubb has emerged as a key link in the European effort to keep Donald Trump onside in support for Ukraine, due to a warm relationship with the US president.
In Poland, Tusk and Nawrocki addressed troops after the incursion.
Tusk visited an airbase in the city of Łask and praised the air force for its quick response. He said a “great modernisation programme” for Poland’s military forces, already announced, would be even more important after the incursion, and said Poland should receive the first delivery of F-35 fighter jets from the United States next year, part of a package of 32 aircraft in a long-agreed deal.
“We hope that the Americans will meet the deadlines. We would like the first batch of the F-35s to reach you in May, and so that we can speak of our air power with increasing confidence from month to month, and from year to year. And that Poland is truly safe from the sky,” Tusk told the troops.
As a precaution, Poland said it was closing air traffic in the eastern part of the country, close to the borders with Russia and Ukraine, to civil flights until 9 December. The country’s air traffic control agency said the measure was “to assure national security”. Airspace over Ukraine has been closed to civil flights since the full-scale invasion in February 2022, while Ukrainian drone attacks in recent months have regularly forced Russian airports to close.
Poland said some of the drones that entered its airspace came from Belarusian territory, where Russian and local troops are preparing to begin major military exercises on Friday.","https://www.theguardian.com/profile/shaun-walker,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jakub-krupa",2025-09-11T15:26:45.000Z,,,,,,,2025-09-11T15:57:01

eighbors in the upscale
Florida
community of Windermere know them as Peter and Nancy, the seemingly friendly retired couple they wave to on morning walks, and who always appear to enjoy visits from their two high-flying grown daughters, one a respected professor of science at Harvard University.
Yet behind the high walls of their $3.6m lakefront mansion lies a darker, more closely guarded reality: “Peter” is actually Parviz Sabeti, the alleged head of secret police and chief torturer of the former Shah of Iran’s pre-revolutionary government, now facing a
$225m lawsuit
in Florida for atrocities committed in prisons in Tehran and elsewhere.
A district court judge ruled last month that the 89-year-old Sabeti – after crafting a successful and anonymous new life for himself and his family since fleeing his homeland in 1978 – must face trial in the case brought by three plaintiffs who describe themselves as former political prisoners.
In court filings, the plaintiffs say they were among thousands of people rounded up as perceived opponents of the shah by
Savak
, Iran’s notoriously brutal internal security and intelligence agency, and subjected to abuses at Sabeti’s personal direction – including rape, electric shocks, near-drownings and forced nail extraction.
One particularly barbaric piece of equipment, they allege, was Apollo, an electric chair named after the early US space program, which featured a metal helmet that amplified victims’ screams into their own ears.

Sabeti has not responded publicly to the allegations in the court filings, but has previously denied that Savak tortured detainees and claimed that he “
always opposed torture
”.
While Sabeti’s location was unknown for the best part of 45 years, his position in the Iranian government, and alleged role as an architect of its cruelty as director of Savak’s internal security department, was not.
He was identified as a fiercely loyal ally of the shah in a secret
analysis by the US Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) written in 1978, which was not released until 2018, and was “widely recognized as one of the most
powerful and feared men
in the shah’s regime … with the authority to apprehend, interrogate and prosecute opponents throughout the country”, according to the lawsuit.
Estimates vary of the number of Savak victims between the agency’s founding in 1957 and its dissolution in 1979, but many thousands were known to have been
detained and tortured
, with at least several hundred more killed.
The three plaintiffs, Iranian men living in California aged 68 to 85, allege they were abducted by Savak in Tehran, beaten into giving false confessions and served prison time. A motion by Sabeti’s lawyers to dismiss the case for breaching the statute of limitations was rejected by district court judge Gregory Presnell of the central district of Florida on 12 August. A trial could take place early next year.
According to the lawsuit, Sabeti “has spent the last four decades out of the public eye, concealing his whereabouts and identity”. He and his wife, Nasrin, 75, might even have remained incognito had he not been inadvertently “outed” by one of his daughters
in a February 2023 tweet
showing him at a rally in Los Angeles denouncing Iran’s Islamic government.
While the disclosure may have been inadvertent, and directly led to the plaintiffs’ attorneys being able to locate him and file the lawsuit, some believe it was part of a campaign by the Iranian diaspora in the US to help “sanitize” the history of the former shah’s deposed government and build momentum and support for a new pro-western regime.
Reza Pahlavi, sometimes called the “crown prince” of Iran as son of the former shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, told the Guardian
in a 2023 interview
, at the height of anti-Tehran protests, that he was working with allies to draw up a charter of democratic principles for any new Iranian government to follow. He has since portrayed himself as ready to replace the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and
become interim head of state
.
Sabeti, meanwhile, has worked as Pahlavi’s “security adviser”, according to a
2023 article
posted to the website of the National Council of Resistance to Iran, a coalition of Iranian political figures portraying itself as a parliament in exile.
Efforts by the Guardian to reach Sabeti were unsuccessful, including emails and calls to his home, and messages seeking comment to all four of his attorneys listed in court documents.

Not in question is how well Sabeti and his family have lived in the US since arriving in Florida in 1978, having fled Tehran just weeks ahead of the
1979 Islamic revolution
.
The Sabetis, who according to
leaked state department documents
were able to transfer a sizable sum of money from Iran – said by one source to be above $20m – westernized their first names to Peter and Nancy after their arrival.
Using those aliases, Sabeti set up what was to become a successful real estate development company in central Florida. Sabeti, his wife and two daughters are listed as directors of several still-active companies on the state of Florida’s business database.
Public records seen by the Guardian show that the Sabeti family own at least eight properties in Orange county, including the five-bedroom, six-bathroom Windermere mansion purchased for $3.5m in August 2005.
The state department and the CIA did not respond to questions about the Sabetis’ immigration status in the US, or the grounds on which they were first admitted in 1978. Both Parviz and Nasrim Sabeti, however, hold active voter registrations in Florida, and records show they voted in the 2024 presidential election, meaning both are US citizens.
A neighbor said she would often see the couple, particularly Nasrim, out walking, but that the Sabetis mostly appeared to value their privacy. Their house was almost always quiet, apart from occasional visits by their daughters.
Neither daughter responded to a request for comment.
Florida’s Republican attorney general, James Uthmeier, did not respond to a question about whether he would launch a criminal investigation into Sabeti’s activities, as he previously has for other people in Florida
accused of nefarious crimes
overseas.
Sara Colón, an attorney for the plaintiffs, welcomed Presnell’s orders to deny Sabeti’s request for dismissal, and to preserve the anonymity of her clients, who said they had been subjected to death threats and intimidation since filing the lawsuit.

“These decisions are a positive result for survivors of torture who are seeking accountability and justice. This case is not only about ending impunity, it is about affirming that survivors have the right to pursue justice and reclaim their dignity without fear,” she said.
The Iranian Collective for Justice & Accountability, an advocacy group for victims of torture and their families, said it hoped the Sabeti case would help end a “cycle of violence” seen in Iran during the shah’s regime and the Islamic fundamentalist government that succeeded it.
“The message should be clear and simple: all victims deserve justice, and everyone engaged in torture and repression should be held accountable,” a spokesperson for the group said in a statement.
“The roots of the brutal policies being carried out today by the Islamic Republic of Iran are connected to the torture methods enacted by Sabeti and Savak. [The case] should stand as a rejection of a future Iran that re-establishes Savak, or seeks to provide blanket amnesty to current security forces who have been involved in torture and repression.
“It is only through justice and accountability that we can overcome the horrific violence and repression that has ruled Iran for decades.”",https://www.theguardian.com/profile/richardluscombe,2025-09-11T09:00:32.000Z,,,,,,,2025-09-11T15:57:03

Benjamin Netanyahu
“killed any hope” for the remaining hostages in Gaza following Israel’s extraordinary strike on Hamas negotiators in Doha on Tuesday.
In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani called the deadly strike in the Qatari capital an act of “state terror”. Israel’s attack the previous day killed six members of Hamas who were negotiating a ceasefire deal brokered by the US and other Gulf countries.
“He needs to be brought to justice,” al-Thani said of the Israeli prime minister.
Netanyahu has responded defiantly to international criticism for the attack, including a White House statement that the “unilateral bombing” inside
Qatar
“does not advance Israel or America’s goals.”
In a video statement, Netanyahu accused Qatar of harbouring terrorists and suggested he reserved the right to continue attacks in the future. “I say to Qatar and all nations who harbour terrorists, you either expel them or you bring them to justice,” he said. “Because if you don’t, we will.”
Al-Thani accused Netanyahu of “wasting” Qatar’s time in hosting negotiations between Israel and
Hamas
and said his country would reassess “everything” about its role as mediator in the conflict.
“I was meeting one of the hostage’s families the morning of the attack,” al-Thani said. “They are counting on this [ceasefire] mediation, they have no other hope for that.”
Map showing location of Israeli strike in Doha.
“I think that what Netanyahu has done yesterday, he just killed any hope for those hostages,” he added.
Other Israeli officials have also responded defiantly to public criticism over the strike, amid doubt over whether the missiles fired by Israeli air force planes had killed any of their primary targets.
On Wednesday, the country’s defence minister, Israel Katz, warned its “long arm will act against its enemies anywhere”.
“There is no place where they can hide,” Katz wrote on X, adding: “Everyone who took part in the 7 October massacre will be held fully accountable. Anyone who carries out terror against Israel will be harmed.”
The Israeli ambassador to the US, Yechiel Leiter, told Fox News that if the strike had not killed Hamas leaders, it would succeed “next time”.
Qatar, a close US ally, has been hosting negotiations aimed at securing a ceasefire in the
Gaza
war, and plays a key role as an intermediary. The Hamas leaders were reported to have been meeting to discuss a new ceasefire proposal put forward by the US president, Donald Trump.
In a social media post, Trump insisted he played no role in the attack. “This was a decision made by prime minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu, it was not a decision made by me,” he wrote on his Truth Social network. He said his administration had tried to warn Qatar of the attack but was “unfortunately, too late”.
Hamas said in a statement that all of its leaders were safe, but five lower-ranked members were reportedly killed. A senior Israeli official admitted on Wednesday that optimism about the success of the strikes was waning.
Qatar said one of its security forces was killed in the attack and accused Israel of “state terrorism”.
Israel deployed its air power again on Wednesday, with a strike in
Yemen
. Almasirah TV, which is run by the Houthi militia movement that rules much of the country, reported that the defence ministry in the capital, Sana’a, had been hit. Israeli Army Radio said Houthi headquarters and military camps were among the targets.
Keir Starmer, the British prime minister,
condemned the attack in Qatar
, saying Israel violated Qatar’s sovereignty and did “nothing to secure the peace that the UK and so many of our allies are committed to”.
Russia and China also condemned the attack, while regional rulers headed to Qatar in a show of solidarity.

In Israel, the attacks prompted celebrations but also anxiety among families of the hostages held in Gaza, who said they were fearful for the fate of their loved ones after 23 months of conflict.
The war was triggered by a Hamas attack into Israel in October 2023 during which militants killed 1,200, mostly civilians, and abducted 250. Of those, 48 hostages remain in Gaza, but fewer than half are thought to be alive.
The Israeli offensive that followed has so far killed more than 64,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, injured more than 150,000 and reduced much of Gaza to ruins.
“Why does the prime minister insist on blowing up every small chance for a deal? Why? The people of Israel are tired of this war. End it already and bring everyone back,” said Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan was kidnapped from his kibbutz.
Q&A
Why is it so difficult to report on Gaza?
Show
Coverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war.
Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and other
restrictions
include a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.
Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over
180 killed
since the conflict began.
The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.
Foreign reporters based in Israel filed a
legal petition
seeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals by
prominent journalists
and

Successive polls have shown broad support in Israel for a deal to end the war and free the hostages, while Netanyahu has been accused of prolonging the conflict for political ends.
Qatar has hosted several rounds of indirect Israel-Hamas talks in Doha and helped broker two short-lived truces, with the US and Egypt as fellow mediators.
Andreas Krieg, a senior lecturer at King’s College London, called it a “strike right at the heart of regional mediation” – and one that Washington failed to prevent. “It shows that Trump is unable to actually enforce the policy that he is setting, which was one built around mediation,” he said.

Hamas, which has ruled Gaza for nearly two decades but today controls only parts, on Saturday once again said that it would release all hostages if Israel agreed to end the war and withdraw its forces from Gaza.
Netanyahu is pushing for a comprehensive deal that would see all of the hostages released at once, Hamas disarming and militant leaders exiled.
Amos Nadan, director of the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies, said Tuesday’s strike could have been intended to be a similar move to last year’s
assassination of Hassan Nasrallah
, the leader of the Lebanese militia and Hamas ally Hezbollah, which was followed by an
Israel-Lebanon ceasefire two months later
.
“In Israel … the vast majority of the people now are in favour of ending the war and bringing back the hostages … So that might look like the concluding remarks of the war,” Nadan said.
Meanwhile in Sana’a, people said Wednesday’s attack had struck a hideout between two mountains that was used as a command-and-control headquarters. The extent of any damage was not immediately clear.

Gaza
to oversee security at food distribution sites backed by the US and Israeli governments,
according to a BBC investigation
.
The investigation found that more than 10 members of Infidels MC, a US biker gang that uses the Crusader cross as its symbol and whose members have anti-Islamic tattoos, have been hired by UG Solutions and deployed to food aid sites run by the
Gaza
Humanitarian Foundation. According to the BBC, seven members of the gang are in “senior positions overseeing [GHF] sites”.
They include the gang’s leader, Johnny “Taz” Mulford, who is a “country team leader” for UG Solutions and had recruited others to work for UG solutions in Gaza. He has the numbers 1095 tattooed across his chest – the year that Pope Urban II launched the first Crusade.
Mulford, whose affiliation with GHF was public, accidentally sent an email to the BBC telling other leaders of the group not to comment on inquiries – inadvertently revealing the identities of several other senior Infidels members also working for UG Solutions.
One of the contractors, Josh Miller, posted a photograph of contractors in Gaza holding a banner at an aid site that reads: “Make Gaza Great Again.” He has the numbers 1095 tattooed on his fingers.
GHF’s operations have come under scrutiny as the US and Israeli-backed group has supplanted nearly every other major humanitarian organisation working in the Gaza Strip in what critics have called a deliberate effort to politicise humanitarian aid. The US government has disbursed at least $30m in grants to GHF.
Areas near GHF sites have become particularly dangerous for hungry Palestinians seeking food. According to a UN report released in early August, at least 859 Palestinians had been killed near GHF sites. Former employees of UG solutions have told media that contractors at GHF sites have opened fire on aid-seeking Palestinians, even if there was no direct threat.
UG Solutions told the BBC that its contractors do not fire on civilians, said Mulford was “trusted and respected”, and that “we stand by his reputation, record, and his contributions to the success of complex missions.” However, the company has previously admitted that warning shots have been used to disperse crowds.
“We do not screen for personal hobbies or affiliations unrelated to job performance or security standards. Every team member undergoes comprehensive background checks, and only qualified, vetted individuals are deployed on UG Solutions operations,” UG Solutions told the BBC.
In a statement to the Guardian, GHF said: “The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation maintains a strict zero-tolerance policy toward any form of hateful or discriminatory behavior. Mr Mulford has not been involved with GHF since August and we are actively reviewing additional allegations.”

The evacuation orders
were accompanied by intensified Israeli bombing of the city, the Israeli military interspersing orders with announcements of high-rise towers they had bombed.
“For your safety, take the time to protect yourself and your family members,” Avichay Adraee, the Arabic spokesperson of the Israeli military, said while sharing videos of crowds of people fleeing
Gaza
City.
The Israeli military has tried to push the around 1 million residents of Gaza City to what it says is a humanitarian zone in al-Mawasi, southern Gaza, for weeks before finally issuing an official evacuation order on Tuesday.
Very few people had left Gaza City before the order, with the UN estimating that only 50,000 people did so over recent weeks. Many residents said they would not leave Gaza City regardless of the official order to evacuate, as they did not trust Israel’s promise that al-Mawasi would be safe.

Israel regularly strikes al-Mawasi despite designating it as a safe zone, and hundreds of thousands of people already live there in tent encampments.
“There is no safe zone in the Gaza Strip. Danger is everywhere,” Fawzi Muftah told the Associated Press as he watched others evacuate the city.
The evacuation order has been accompanied by increasing military pressure and degradation of humanitarian conditions in Gaza City.
Over the last five days, the Israeli military has been bombing high-rise buildings in the city, which it claims housed
Hamas
infrastructure. It has released videos of bombs striking the bottom of the buildings, flattening them in seconds.
Residents said they received a call to evacuate the buildings about 20 minutes before they were struck. The bombings left many of them without a place to go and brought renewed pressure to leave the city.
Amnesty International condemned the displacement order, saying it compounds the suffering of civilians amid what the human rights organisation has deemed a genocide.
“The order issued [on Tuesday] by the Israeli military for the mass displacement of Gaza City residents is cruel, unlawful and further compounds the genocidal conditions of life that Israel is inflicting on Palestinians,” said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s director for the Middle East and North Africa.
Gaza City is
in the throes of famine
, primarily caused by Israel’s blockade of aid into the territory. Humanitarian organisations have said that a blockaded Gaza City and its accompanying wave of displacement would only exacerbate this famine. They further warned that al-Mawasi, already overburdened with the displaced, did not have the capacity to absorb 1 million more people.
Five more people died from starvation in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number who have starved to death in Gaza over the last 23 months to 404.
International condemnation of Israel’s plans to take over and occupy Gaza City continues to grow. Israel’s unprecedented
strike on Hamas leaders in Qatar
on Tuesday, which most states deemed a violation of sovereignty, further increased Israel’s international isolation.
The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, called for sanctions and a partial
trade suspension against Israel
on Wednesday over its conduct in Gaza. The EU is a valuable economic partner for Israel, constituting nearly a third of its trade.
“Man-made famine can never be a weapon of war. For the sake of the children, for the sake of humanity, this must stop,” von der Leyen said at the European parliament in Strasbourg on Wednesday. Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Saar, said her calls for sanctions would embolden Hamas.

It is unclear if all 27 member states would allow the EU to take the actions that von der Leyen called for, as states such as Germany and Hungary have blocked similar moves in the past.
Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed more than 64,600 Palestinians over the last 23 months, with many more whose bodies have not yet been found. Israel launched the war in response to an attack by Hamas-led militants that killed about 1,200 people on 7 October 2023.",https://www.theguardian.com/profile/william-christou,2025-09-10T16:45:26.000Z,,,,,,,2025-09-11T15:57:10

KP Sharma Oli’s resignation came a day after
widespread protests were met with deadly force
by police, leaving 19 dead and hundreds injured. The spark for the protests was a government ban on 26 prominent social media apps, but escalated into a larger mass movement against corruption among political elites.
The government decision to roll back the ban on sites such as Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube and X on Monday night did nothing to quell the anger among young people, who continued what was called the “Gen Z” protests.

In defiance of curfews, protests continued to erupt across the country on Tuesday and thousands stormed the federal parliament building in Kathmandu and set it alight. Fires burned across the streets of the capital, turning the sky black with smoke, and riot police were pelted with stones.
The country’s political leaders were evacuated to safe locations, as anger at the government swelled on the streets, and Kathmandu airport was closed down.
As calls for the resignation of Oli grew on Tuesday, his home was set on fire. Homes of the president and other prominent ministers were also attacked as Gen Z protesters took control of the country’s main administrative area, Singha Durbar.
By early Tuesday afternoon Oli had submitted his resignation letter to the president , an announcement which was met with cheers by protesters who were gathered around the parliament building, and Nepal’s president, Ram Chandra Paudel. The home minister had already resigned on Monday night over the killing of protesters.
Chaos continued in the streets even after Oli’s resignation and by Tuesday night, Nepal’s army chief confirmed that army troops were to be deployed on the streets from 10pm to maintain order. “Some groups are taking undue advantage of the extraordinary circumstances to cause extensive damage to ordinary citizens and public property,” said the army in a statement.

Rohan Ansari, 20, said he had seen his friend shot dead by police before his eyes on Monday as they protested in the streets of Kathmandu. “But today, the Gen Z movement has succeeded,” he said, standing outside the stormed parliament building, which billowed with thick black smoke. “Now, his soul will rest in peace. From now on, the work will be led by the youth. The files of their corruption will be exposed.”
Oli, 73, is seen as a veteran of Nepali politics and began his fourth term last year after his Communist party forged a coalition government with the centre-left Nepali Congress. In his letter, Oli said he had resigned in order to “facilitate a solution to the problem and help resolve it politically”. In the aftermath of Oli’s resignation, Nepal’s president, Ram Chandra Paudel, invited Gen Z protest leaders for talks.
Dissatisfaction, particularly among the younger generation, has grown as Nepal has been crippled by political instability, corruption and slow economic development, with swathes of the population forced to travel abroad to find work.
A string of high-profile corruption cases among senior political figures has dominated headlines and social media has been awash with images of the luxury spending habits of the children of the country’s political elites, fuelling resentment as ordinary Nepalis face economic hardship and and unemployment.
Naresh Rawal, 27, said the protests had been the only way to force change. “Corruption has gone so far that leaders have accumulated Land Rovers, bullets and millions of rupees in their homes,” said Rawal.
“They don’t drink regular water, they have cartons of imported water. Where does all that luxury come from? Where did this wealth come from? Where did their children get money for lavish trips every month? This is why this was necessary action. Now the country can move forward on the path of reform.”
Tanuja Pandey, 24, was among those who called for Oli and his ministers to face a criminal investigation for the deadly use of force against protesters. “This is not just a death of 19 youths – it is murder,” she said. “The government’s hands are stained with blood. The government cannot escape accountability this time.”

The government said on Monday it had formed a committee to investigate the violence and would pay compensation to the families of the dead and provide free treatment for injured people.
Amnesty International said live ammunition had been used against protesters on Monday, and the United Nations demanded a swift and transparent inquiry.
The ban on social media came after Nepal’s government gave social media firms a seven-day deadline to register and comply with new regulations. All but five failed to register on time and as a result Meta’s Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, Alphabet’s YouTube, China’s Tencent and Snapchat, Pinterest and X were blocked by midnight on Thursday.
The government’s decision caused outrage among Nepal’s youth, many who saw it as an attempt to suppress their criticism of the government.
“The corruption that has permeated every level of the country must end,” said Raksha Bam, 26
. “
But instead of stopping that corruption, they shut down the civic space of our generation. That is why Gen Z gathered in one place.”
Many of those on the streets said it was time that politicians represented the needs of the younger generation. “Our movement will not remain limited to this,” said protester Khem Neupane, 31.

Instagram
, WhatsApp and X.
The government has faced mounting criticism after imposing a ban on 26 prominent social media platforms and messaging apps last week because they had missed a deadline to register under new regulations.
On Monday, frustration at the ban boiled over on the streets of the capital, Kathmandu, and in smaller cities across the country.
Tens of thousands of largely young people gathered to protest against the ban and over wider allegations of corruption and authoritarianism on the part of the government, led by the prime minister,
KP Sharma Oli
.
In Kathmandu, clashes with police erupted as protesters broke through barriers and attempted to storm the parliament building and set fire to the gate.
Police responded with deadly and allegedly indiscriminate force, firing live rounds of ammunition and teargas as well as hitting protesters with batons, rubber bullets and water cannon.

Police confirmed at least 19 people had died from serious injuries sustained at the protests, including bullet injuries to the head and chest.
Most died in the clashes in Kathmandu but two were killed when protests turned violent in the eastern city of Itahari. More than 200 were injured and receiving treatment in hospital.
The demonstrations have been labelled the “gen Z protest” in a nod to the youth-led movement that circumvented the social media shutdown to mobilise the masses.
Many protesters – some out in their school uniforms – sought to emphasise they had taken to the streets as part of a bigger agenda to fight the corruption and nepotism they allege is rampant among Nepal’s political elite, and held up placards with slogans such as “youths against corruption”.
The death toll from Monday’s protests intensified anger on the streets and protests continued well into the evening, despite attempts by the government to impose a curfew in areas of unrest. By Monday night, the home minister, Ramesh Lekhak, had resigned in response to the police killings.
The UN demanded an immediate probe into the state violence unleashed on the protests.
“We are shocked by the killings and injury of protesters in Nepal today and urge a prompt and transparent investigation,” UN human rights office spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani said in a statement.
The almost blanket social media ban came into effect at midnight on Thursday and subsequently caused chaos across the country, affecting businesses and tourism and leaving people unable to communicate with relatives abroad.
LinkedIn, Pinterest, Reddit and Signal were also among the banned sites.
TikTok
was one of the few not restricted – after it complied with the registration order – and it became a key tool of mobilisation.
Since the ban, videos contrasting the struggles of ordinary Nepalis with the children of politicians flaunting luxury goods and expensive holidays have gone viral on TikTok, further fuelling anger at the government.
Nepal’s ministry of communications and information technology said it had given social media companies seven days to follow the country’s laws and register after a court order, but all but five had failed to meet the deadline. A notice from the ministry said that subsequently an order had been issued to “deactivate” the platforms.
The government said the new regulations were aimed at cracking down on hate speech, fake news and online crimes. The ban had already drawn condemnation from international rights organisations. In a statement, the Committee to Protect Journalists NGO warned that the ban set a “dangerous precedent for press freedom”.
On Sunday, dozens of journalists had gathered in Kathmandu to protest against the ban, holding up signs with slogans including “no shutdown of social networks”, “no silencing of voices”, “freedom of expression is our right” and “democracy hacked, authoritarianism back”.

Prior to Monday’s protests turning violent, the country’s prime minister hit back at critics, saying he would not tolerate the “nation being undermined”.
“The independence of the nation is greater than the loss of jobs of a handful of individuals. How can it be acceptable to defy the law, disregard the constitution and disrespect national dignity, independence and sovereignty?” Oli said in a speech on Sunday.
While Nepal remains a largely unrestricted country for freedom of expression, critics say there is a growing overreach by the Oli government that has caused concern.
In 2023,
TikTok was banned for nine months
over concerns of hate speech and cybercrime but it was reinstated once the platform agreed to register with the government.

By Wednesday, many woke to find their fears realised as the worst floods in more than three decades ravaged their farms and decimated their livelihoods.
Hundreds of thousands of acres of bright green rice paddies – due to be harvested imminently – as well as crops of cotton and sugar cane were left destroyed as they became fully submerged in more than five feet of muddy brown flood waters. The bodies of drowned cattle littered the ground.
“The crops are ruined, and even our homes are in danger of collapsing,” said Parmpreet Singh, 52, a farmer from Ajnala in Amritsar district, Punjab. His family, including his elderly mother and two young children, were now living on the roof of their house to stay safe from the murky flood waters.
“My entire livelihood depends on my seven hectares of farmland, all of which has been destroyed by flood waters,” he said, despairing that his only option left would be to sell his land and abandon farming. “I had already invested most of my money into seeds and fertilisers for the previous crop. Now everything is gone.”
While monsoon season usually brings heavy rain, the extreme levels of rainfall that fell across northern India this week caused untold damage in Punjab, resulting in flash floods and swollen rivers breaching their banks and overflowing into fields and villages. So far, 43 people have lost their lives and almost 2,000 villages in the state have been affected, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without electricity and access to clean water. The stench of rotting animal carcasses hangs over many villages.

“This is the worst time Punjab has ever faced,” said Parminder Singh Pinki, a lawmaker from Firozpur district in western Punjab, one of the areas badly hit by floods.
“I have never witnessed such devastation in my lifetime. Entire farmlands are submerged under water, now layered with mud and sand.”
India’s farmers have already faced mounting hardship, with millions saddled with high debts, low incomes and heavy crop losses in the face of increasingly extreme and unpredictable weather conditions brought on by the climate crisis.
Pinki was among those who accused the ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) government, led by Narendra Modi, of negligence towards farmers and simply abandoning them to their fate during this year’s extreme monsoon.
“The government had been aware for months about the weather forecasts and should have put proper measures and emergency responses in place,” he said. “But that never happened, and this failure has led to destruction on such a massive scale.”
He was echoed by Surinder Singh, 75, a farmer from Sarala Kalan village in Patiala. For days, he had watched the canal near to their village getting higher and higher, but had been powerless to stop it.
“The government will make promises of relief, but the farmers will end up receiving nothing,” he said. “In the end, we are left to take care of ourselves.” Like many, he questioned the long-term viability of Indian agriculture, which employs half the country’s workforce and keeps food on the country’s tables.
“I cannot imagine what is left for our future generations,” he said. “Floods and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent, and the future does not look any better. If the farmers of Punjab – the food bowl of India – cannot even feed themselves, how will they feed others?”

This crisis has not been India’s alone. Across the border, in Pakistan’s agriculture-heavy province also called Punjab, the devastation caused by floods has been even more catastrophic, with almost 2 million people evacuated and about 4,000 villages submerged in flood waters.

The two countries share several major rivers and the Indian government’s decision to release water from several heavily filled dams upstream has led to further flooding on both sides of the border in the geographical region of Punjab, prompting Pakistani officials to try to blame India for the disaster.
Such was the fury of the overflowing Ravi River, which runs through the border of India into Pakistan, that on Friday it ripped down 30km of iron fencing that forms the highly militarised border between the two conflicting neighbours, and forced India’s border security force soldiers to abandon dozens of their highly sensitive posts.
Maratab Ali Gondal, a farmer from Mandi Bahauddin district in Pakistani Punjab, said the rising levels of the Chenab River, which also flows from India, had washed away 90 acres of his crops, including rice and sugar cane, causing losses of millions of rupees.
Gondal said he had spent the previous months begging local officials to build embankments along the river, which would protect farmland, but nothing had been done. “The water erosion has taken all of my land. There is flood water everywhere now. This is not the fault of India; it was [Pakistani] Punjab government negligence which swept away my farmland,” he said.
He added: “This is not only my story – our farmers have been witnessing the worst time in the country’s history.”

It was not only farmland that was affected. Residents of the highly affluent housing development Park View Society in Lahore, recently constructed just a few hundred metres away from the bank of the Ravi, also found their multimillion-rupee homes filled with murky flood water. Experts said that rapid deforestation and development along the waterways was only worsening the likelihood of floods in the area.
Umar, a resident who moved to the development this year, said his home had been filled with five feet of river water. “Many of us have invested our life savings in buying or constructing a dream house here,” he said. “But how could they be allowed to build it if it is at such risk of flooding?”
Maryam Nawaz Sharif, the chief minister of Pakistani Punjab, who is also the niece of Pakistan’s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, was accused of doing little to help those affected by the flooding. In a social media post, she highlighted how portable toilets were being installed at a relief camp to help the displaced – however, the image she shared was revealed to be from two years ago.","https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-ellis-petersen,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/aakash-hassan,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/shah-meer-baloch",2025-09-06T04:00:42.000Z,,,,,,,2025-09-11T15:57:17

Afghanistan
this week has jumped to more than 2,200, just as another magnitude 6.2 earthquake hit the southeastern region of the country on Thursday night.
On Thursday, Taliban spokesperson Hamdullah Fitrat
confirmed that the death toll from Sunday’s earthquake had risen to 2,205
– up from previous estimates of 1,400 – making it one of the deadliest natural disasters to hit the country in decades.
The shallow, magnitude-6.0 quake struck the mountainous and remote eastern part of the country around midnight on Sunday, levelling entire villages where residents were asleep and trapping people under rubble.
Fears rose after another earthquake, this time with a 6.2 magnitude, struck southeastern Afghanistan on Thursday night, according to the German Research Centre for Geosciences. It was not immediately clear how much further damage it has caused.
Afghanistan faces 'overlapping crises' after a week of earthquakes – video
It was the third major quake to hit the country this week, after another 5.5 magnitude aftershock struck on Tuesday, causing panic and interrupting rescue efforts as more roads were cut off by rockfall.
Most of the casualties from Sunday’s earthquake have been in Kunar province, where most people typically live in wood and mud-brick houses along steep river valleys, separated by high mountains, which were highly vulnerable to the impact of the quake.
The death toll rose steeply on Thursday as rescue operatives managed to reach villages that had been completely cut off in the disaster and bodies continued to be pulled from debris. Fitrat said that search and rescue operations were still ongoing to recover the injured and dead.
About 98% of the buildings in the province were damaged or destroyed, according to an assessment issued on Thursday by the charity Islamic Relief.
The rough, steeply mountainous terrain has been hindering relief efforts. Taliban authorities have deployed helicopters and airdropped army commandos to help locate and rescue survivors. Aid workers reported walking for hours to reach villages cut off by landslides and rockfall.
Muhammad Israel said the quake unleashed a landslide that buried his home, livestock and belongings in Kunar. “All the rocks came down from the mountain,” he said. “I barely got my children out of there … The earthquake jolts are still happening. It is impossible to live there.”
He was staying at a UN medical camp in Nurgal, one of the worst-affected districts. “The situation is also bad for us here, we don’t have shelter and are living under open skies,” he said.
Rescue and relief efforts have also been impacted by a lack of international aid funding and resources flowing into the country. Since the Taliban seized back power in 2021 and began imposing hardline religious laws, making it difficult for NGOs and aid groups to function, there has been a steep drop in aid and support to Afghanistan.
Aid agencies said they were urgently in need of staff and supplies to tend to the injured and to house tens of thousands who had been left homeless and without access to food or water. According to aid agencies, around 84,000 people have been affected so far.
The Norwegian Refugee Council said it had fewer than 450 staff in Afghanistan, whereas it had 1,100 in 2023 when the last major quake struck the country. The council had only one warehouse remaining and no emergency stock.
“We will need to purchase items once we get the funding but this will take potentially weeks and people are in need now,” said Maisam Shafiey, a communications and advocacy adviser for the council in Afghanistan. “We have only $100,000 available to support emergency response efforts. This leaves an immediate funding gap of $1.9m.”
Shamshair Khan, a doctor tending to the injured at the UN camp in Nurgal, said supplies were already running out. “Neither these medicines are enough nor these services,” he said. “These people need more medicine and tents. They need food and clean drinking water. They need more aid. These people are in great pain.”

I'm currently at the Pentagon, where just moments ago President Trump stepped into the lectern at a memorial service for 9/11.
He began his remarks by addressing the death of Charlie Kirk directly as he spoke to a crowd of several dozen people, including service members in uniform and families of those who fell on 9/11.
""We miss him greatly,"" Trump told the crowd. ""Yet I have no doubt that Charlie's voice and the courage that he put into the hearts of countless people, especially young people, will live on"".
Trump then announced the he will posthumously award Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest honour that a civilian can be awarded in the US.
""I can only guarantee you one thing - that we will have a very big crowd,"" he said. ""Very, very big.""
As he spoke, I saw several members of the crowd, including civilians and several dressed in Army and Marine Corps uniforms, nodding silently.
The significance of Charlie's death was also remarked upon by Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, who compared him to those who perished on 9/11.

Witnesses describe scene before and after Charlie Kirk shot
Attendees at the campus event where US conservative activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot on Wednesday have described mass panic after a shot was heard.
Kirk, 31, was killed after he was hit in the neck by a single bullet, which law enforcement believes came from a shooter on the roof of a nearby building.
The influencer and close Donald Trump ally had been speaking to about 3,000 people on his American Comeback Tour at Utah Valley University.
Videos on social media show Kirk talked about gun violence moments before he was shot.
One eyewitness told the BBC's US partner CBS: ""Me and my buddies were having a good time just listening to what was going on and we just saw it, heard a loud shout, loud bang and then I saw his body actually in slow motion kind of fall over"".
Porter LaFerber, a student at Utah Valley University who described himself as a ""big fan"" of Kirk's and was at the rally, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he was about 50ft (15m) away from Kirk.
""I was sitting there filming him, I cut my video and just then I heard this shot,"" he said.
""You don't really realise what's happened until it's happened. Charlie falls off his stool, everyone starts panicking.""
LaFerber said he hid behind a ""cement terrace"" and then after about a minute of ""not hearing another gunshot, I got up and just booked it to the closest building I could see"".
Tiana Lao, 20, who was at the event with her housemate, said they were both crying amid the panic to flee the scene. ""I was shaking uncontrollably,"" she told BBC Newsbeat.
In a video shared by news agency Reuters, an eyewitness called Danielle said she was closer to Kirk - about 15ft (5m) away.
""It was horrible,"" she said. ""All I hear is screaming and I see people running and I'm like, 'it's not safe to run. It's not safe to get up'...And all I'm saying is, 'please, God, please, God, please, God,' because I don't want to die.""
Students flee as Charlie Kirk is shot while speaking to a crowd of hundreds
Jason Chaffetz, a former US congressman told Fox News he was at the event with his daughter when it happened.
""The shot came straight at him,"" he said, adding that ""everyone hit the deck"" and ""scattered"".
Adam Bartholomew, who was at the event interviewing counter-protesters who were speaking against Kirk's presence on campus, also said people initially dropped to the floor.
""There was confusion and people started scrambling for the exits,"" he told the BBC.
""Several people are in tears,"" he said of the atmosphere after the shooting.
Videos taken by witnesses show the rush to flee the scene after the shooting occurred.
A figure on the roof in separate video coverage appears to have been approximately 130m (142 yards) away from where Kirk was sitting.
Phil Lyman, a former Utah state representative, said he had been ""involved politically"" with Kirk and handed out baseball caps on stage with him before the event started.
""I went up to find some other people so I wasn't next to him when he was shot, and I don't know if I'm happy about that or that I wish I could've been there,"" he told the Today programme.
He added that: ""3,000 kids basically watched somebody shot right in front of them, it's really traumatic. Really, really rough.""
Two 17-year-olds, Grace Dishman and Grace Baird, spoke to the BBC from outside the police barricade where they had seen Kirk shot.
The girls, who are members of Turning Point groups at their high school, skipped school to attend the event with the approval of their parents.
Dishman said she never thought she would be anywhere near a shooting. Baird only wanted to get home. ""I just want to hug my mom,"" she said.
Emma Pitts, a reporter at Utah-based Deseret News who attended the event, also described seeing the moment Kirk was shot.
""I'll never get the image out of my head,"" Pitts said.
Pitts added she was surprised that ""nobody scanned our equipment, nobody scanned our bags, there was no security like that.""
Bartholomew also said he was ""surprised"" that there was no security at the event. ""Nobody stopped me or searched my bag.""
Lao said she thought stronger checks should have been in place. ""I am pretty disappointed with the security measures they did not take,"" she said.
Brock Anderson described the situation on campus as ""scary""
The BBC has asked Utah Valley University for comment in response to security measures at the event.
The university had provided six security officers for the talk, in addition to Kirk's private security detail.
In the aftermath of the attack, students were on lockdown and unable to get back to their apartments until the early hours of the morning, as the shooter remained at large.
""It's unsettling around the campus right now, like I'm just trying to walk home, and it's just unsettling,"" said student Brock Anderson.",,2025-09-11T10:09:04.287Z,,,,,,,2025-09-11T15:58:12
news,bbc_world,,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clydk8821nro,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clydk8821nro,Russian drone incursion into Poland will test Nato resolve,"Although Poland has experienced several violations of its airspace since neighbouring Ukraine was attacked by Russia in February 2022, this latest incursion - sizeable, and deep into Polish territory - sparked real nervousness in Warsaw.
Tusk warned that Poland was at its closest to open conflict since World War Two. He also requested invoking Article 4 of the Nato treaty, which allows member countries to start a discussion with allies about threats to their security.
Some experts and analysts are divided over Russia's motivations.
To some, the drones – some of which flew in the direction of Rzeszow airport, a major logistical hub for defence supplies and humanitarian aid bound for Ukraine – may have had reconnaissance purposes, with poor guidance leading to accidental airspace trespass.
""There is an issue with proving intention,"" said Dr Marina Miron, a defence researcher at Kings College London.
She believes GPS spoofing may have been responsible for the drones crossing into Polish airspace and cautioned against drawing conclusions based on snippets of information. ""It can lead [the incident] to appear as something it is not,"" Dr Miron added.
Many others believe, however, the relatively high number of drones flown into Polish airspace clearly demonstrates that the attack was deliberate.
""Previous incursions were single or very small numbers that were more easily explained by guidance system malfunctions,"" Justin Bronk of the defence think tank Rusi told the BBC.
Justin Crump, CEO of the risk and intelligence company Sibylline, agreed. He said the drones in question appear to be Russian-made cheap, long-range drone Gerberas which can be used as decoys to distract defences as part of Russia's increasing ""grey zone actions against Nato"".
The lack of warheads on the Gerberas drones employed on Wednesday make them appear less threatening and allow Russia to play down the action, Mr Crump added.
Poland will now need to review the incident and share the findings with its allies.
Whether deliberate or not, the unprecedented incident will provide valuable information to Moscow on the type of response it can expect from the West should it ever decide to launch an attack on Nato countries, as many European leaders have said they expect it to do in the near future.
""It is a test for Europe and for Nato regardless of Russia's intent"",  said Keir Giles, a senior fellow in the Russia and Eurasia program at Chatham House.
""Russia will learn from European resolve and specifically Poland's capacity to withstand attacks of this kind.""
Expressions of condemnation rather than a robust response will be just as encouraging to Russia if it was an accident as if it were a deliberate provocation, Mr Giles added.
He said a sky shield to protect airspace over Ukraine would prove to Russia the West is serious about ensuring air threats are intercepted.
But such a plan - which would involve European countries deploying fighter jets and pilots - has led to fears of accidental confrontation with the Russians and has not come to pass despite first being floated since 2023.
The US's reaction to the incident in Poland will also be awaited – and closely followed.
Some US lawmakers in both the Democrat and Republican camps condemned the attack soon after it occurred.
However, as of Wednesday evening US President Donald Trump had only acknowledged the events in Poland through a post on social media. ""What's with Russia violating Poland's airspace with drones? Here we go!"", he wrote without elaborating further.
The cryptic post was in line with his ambiguous relationship with Russia and its President Vladimir Putin.
Over the course of the last month Trump both rolled out the red carpet for the Russian president and threatened sanctions against Moscow if it failed to reach peace with Kyiv.
These threats have not yet materialised, and even warnings of unspecified ""consequences"" for Russia's aggression in Ukraine appear to have fallen by the wayside.
As its leaders scramble to put together a show of unity and strength, Europe – which has been concerned about the American commitment to the security of the continent since the start of Trump's second term – will be watching the US's next move just as closely as Russia.
""A sign of weakness and failure to impose costs and consequences will confirm for Moscow that they can continue to escalate without fear of the outcome,"" Mr Giles said.

Chinese nationals, who could only work at Nasa as contractors or students contributing to research, found out on 5 September that they had lost all access to Nasa's systems and facilities, Bloomberg news reported, citing sources.
Nasa then confirmed this, saying Chinese nationals would be restricted from using the agency's ""facilities, materials and networks to ensure the security of our work"".
China's accelerated space programme has alarmed the US and ramped up the race between the two biggest economies.
Chinese astronauts are already excluded from the International Space Station (ISS) because Washington has barred Nasa from sharing its data with China.
The latest restriction from Nasa only adds to the decline in scientific collaboration between the two sides because of national security concerns.
As they compete to gain a technological edge, Beijing and Washington have also grown increasingly wary of each other.
The suspicion has made it harder for some Chinese students, especially those studying science and tech, to get visas, or even enter the US, once they have secured a visa.
There have also been several cases in the US recently of alleged espionage by Chinese nationals, and scientists in particular have come under the scanner.
It's unclear how much notice Nasa gave Chinese nationals who were working for the agency. Bloomberg News reported that they had suddenly found they were denied access to the agency's data systems, and were barred from participating in meetings relating to their work - both in-person and virtual.
Nasa's press secretary Bethany Stevens told news outlets that Nasa had indeed taken ""internal action pertaining to Chinese nationals - including restricting physical and cybersecurity access to our facilities"".
China has made no secret of its space ambitions, with both Beijing and Washington competing to send their crew to the moon.
""We're in a second space race right now,"" Nasa's acting administrator Sean Duffy told reporters in a press conference on Wednesday where he spoke about US discoveries on Mars.
""The Chinese want to get back to the moon before us. That's not going to happen.""
The director of the general technology bureau of China's Manned Space Agency  last year said US concerns were ""unnecessary"", calling China's space exploration a ""collective mission for humanity"".
At a US Senate hearing last week, lawmakers stressed the need for the US to put its boots on the moon before China.
""China has made no secret of its goals,"" said Republican senator Ted Cruz. ""[If] our adversaries achieve dominant space capabilities, it would pose a profound risk to America... [the] stakes could not be higher.""
The race is not just about getting to the Moon. It's also about who can control its resources once they are there.
The Moon contains minerals, including rare earths, metals like iron and titanium - and helium too, which is used in everything from superconductors to medical equipment.",,2025-09-11T10:34:01.480Z,,,,,,,2025-09-11T15:58:16

In a statement, RTÉ said that Ireland's participation in the event ""would be unconscionable given the ongoing and appalling loss of lives in Gaza"".
Ireland has won the contest seven times in total, most recently in 1996.
RTÉ will make a final decision once the Eurovision organisers, the European Broadcasting Union, makes its decision.
Next year's contest will be held in May in Vienna.
Slovenia's national broadcaster, RTVSLO, has also said it will withdraw from the competition if Israel participates.
Spain's Culture Minister Ernest Urtasun has said that his country may also not take part should Israel participate.
Stefán Eiríksson from Iceland's national broadcaster RÚV said its involvement in the 2026 contest was ""subject to the outcome of the ongoing consultation process within the EBU, due to the participation of the Israeli state broadcaster KAN in the competition"".
Mr Eiríksson added that RÚV ""reserve the right to withdraw from participation in it if the EBU does not respond satisfactorily"".
In a statement on Thursday, RTÉ said:  ""It is RTÉ's position that Ireland will not take part in the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest, if the participation of Israel goes ahead, and the final decision regarding Ireland's participation will be made once the EBU's decision is made"".
It added: ""RTÉ is also deeply concerned by the targeted killing of journalists in Gaza, the denial of access to international journalists to the territory, and the plight of the remaining hostages.""
Prior to this year's Eurovision in May,
RTÉ asked the EBU for a discussion on Israel's inclusion in the Eurovision Song Contest
.
At that time, its director general, Kevin Bakhurst, said he was ""appalled by the ongoing events in the Middle East and by the horrific impact on civilians in Gaza, and the fate of Israeli hostages"".
He added that he was mindful of RTÉ's obligations to maintain objectivity in covering the war in Gaza.
""We are also very mindful of the severe political pressure on Israel's public service broadcaster, Kan, from the Israeli government,"" he said.
Earlier this year, more than 70 former Eurovision contestants signed a letter calling on the organisers to ban Israel from the 2025 competition.",,2025-09-11T13:32:03.892Z,,,,,,,2025-09-11T15:58:18

Students flee as Charlie Kirk is shot while speaking to a crowd of hundreds
Moments before the crack of a gunshot changed everything, thousands of students had gathered under clear blue skies at an idyllic Utah college to hear from a man considered a rock star in conservative campus politics.
As the 31-year-old Charlie Kirk sat under a tent, debating political opponents taking their turn at a microphone, many gathered on the lawns cheered – and some protested. Seconds later, they were all running in terror.
The activist was struck in the neck by a bullet, mortally wounded. The episode playing out as cameras rolled, some showing the murder in bloody detail.
The images will be hard to forget - particularly for the many young conservatives for whom Kirk held celebrity status. The leader of their movement, regardless of the ultimate motive behind his killing, will now be viewed as a martyr for the cause.
Kirk, in the past, had warned of what he said was the threat of violence from his critics – of which he had many, given his provocative style of conservativism. Nonetheless he was willing to travel to college campuses, where the politics frequently tilt to the left, and debate all comers.
He was an advocate of gun rights and conservative values, an outspoken critic of transgender rights, and a staunch, unapologetic Donald Trump supporter. His Turning Point US organisation played a key role in the voter turnout drive that saw the president return to the White House this year.
The tent where he was shot had ""prove me wrong"" emblazoned on it. He was a hero to young conservative students in particular, meeting them where they were and offering them a movement of their own.
Kirk's killing is both another episode of shocking gun violence in America – and the latest in an ever-lengthening line of recent political violence.
Earlier this year two Democratic state legislators in Minnesota were shot in their homes – with one dying from her wounds. Last year, Donald Trump was twice the target of assassination attempts. His brush with a bullet at an outdoor rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, bears striking similarities to Wednesday's shooting in Utah – both playing out before gathered crowds at outdoor venues.
Two years before that, a hammer-wielding assailant broke in to the home of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a prominent Democrat. In 2017, a man opened fire on Republican congressmen practising on a northern Virginia baseball field.
It is difficult to divine where American politics goes from here, but the trajectory is bleak.
Violence begets violence. Increasingly divisive rhetoric, fuelled by social media echo chambers and easy access to firearms, leads to raw nerves and a heightened potential for bloodshed.
Watch: Shouting erupts during moment of silence for Charlie Kirk
Conservative activists are reconsidering what security measures are necessary for public appearances, just as many local politicians did after the Minnesota shootings. But the Butler attempt on Trump's life was nearly successful, despite trained local and federal security forces on the scene.
If there is a sense that no-one is safe – that public life itself has become a blood sport – that will have its own corrosive effect on American politics.
Trump, in a video address from the Oval Office posted on his Truth Social website on Wednesday night, called the killing a ""dark moment for America"".
But he wasted little time in blaming the ""radical left"" for Kirk's murder. He ticked through some of the recent instances of political violence - those that targeted conservatives - and said his administration would find ""each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence"".
Those comments are sure to be welcomed by those on the right who in the hours after the shooting called for a crackdown on left-wing groups.
""It is time, within the confines of the law, to infiltrate, disrupt, arrest and incarcerate all of those who are responsible for this chaos,"" conservative activist Christopher Rufo wrote on X.
Watch: 'This is a political assassination', says Utah governor
Many prominent Republicans and Democrats, including potential 2028 presidential contenders, lined up to condemn political violence and call for a cooling of rhetoric.
But in Congress on Wednesday evening, a moment of silence for Kirk was quickly followed by a shouting match between lawmakers - a further indication that partisan tensions are still high.
Meanwhile, in Utah, witnesses, law enforcement and state and local leaders continue to come to grips with the trauma of the day.
In emotional remarks during a press conference, Governor Spencer Cox – who has frequently spoken out against overheated political rhetoric and political divisiveness – described a nation, soon to celebrate a milestone anniversary of its founding, that is ""broken"".
""Is this it?"" he asked. ""Is this what 250 years has wrought upon us?""
""I pray that is not the case,"" he answered.
The doubt in his voice underscored the simple truth that, on this day, the future of America and whether its violent politics can be fixed seems far from certain.
